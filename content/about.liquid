    <!-- WIP Some phrases that I stand for:

    - Be bored
    - If you want something, don't wait for it or have dependencies on others. You
      never know how life changes. YOLO
    - You are 2/3s of your closest loved ones
    - Sleep on it (https://news.yale.edu/2024/08/14/sleep-it-how-brain-processes-many-experiences-even-when-offline)
