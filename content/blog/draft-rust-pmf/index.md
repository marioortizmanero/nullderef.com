Rust is a wonderful programming language that has learned from its predecessors.

But I only see it being useful in a few scenarios:

1. When you really need performance
2. When you want to have fun
3. When you already have Product Market Fit

The performance part might not even be that important, to be honest. TODO

I wanted to leave a use-case for having fun. I'm tired of everything having to have a purpose, or business value. Programming is fun. For some, at least. And it seems like Rust is particularly fun: it's easy to get started, can get very bare metal, but at the same time develop highly complex applications. Even if you don't end up using Rust at your day-to-day job, you'll have learned a lot, and possibly had fun, too.

Other than that, from the business perspective, it's not a great idea.

Does Rust have less bugs than Go? That does affect the customer experience.
