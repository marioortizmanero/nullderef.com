Jen-Hsun Huang -- NVIDIA

- VC don't invest in business plans, it does in people and the market. The
  latter isn't so important because it changes, and you need to reinvent
  yourself. He started with $2M.
- Initial plan was to build chips for 3D gaming; first in the market.
- Perspective > vision. Everyone has it, just specific to yourself,
  surroundings, tastes, etc. Perspective > ideas.
- What's the essence of your business? What makes it work?
- Ignored customers for 5Y to create the industry.
- Why do you want to build a company? I hope it's not money.
- Company growth -> you have to take the initiative to cannibalize your own
  products. Otherwise, someone else will.
- Fail to learn, but fail quickly, "intellectual honesty".
- CEO skill: Become comfortable with ambiguity
- Started at 30yo, no business classes prior
- He learns from anybody (even kids)
- Focus; do one thing well
- Everything is torn apart & reinvented @ some point

- Pending questions: relationships with kids, burnout, working too much?? He
  only seems to work
