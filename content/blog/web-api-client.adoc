This article describes my journey of basically rewriting the entirety of
https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify[Rspotify]; around 13 months of work (in
my free time), starting at September of 2020, up until October of 2021. I think
this has given me enough experience for an article regarding API design on Rust,
and perhaps those who attempt the same in the future can take some ideas and
save time. Specially considering how much I've gone in circles and how much time
I've "`wasted`" implementing things that ended up being discarded.

== The story

If you don't care about Rspotify's specific story, you can jump to the
<<actual_start>> section, but I think knowing a bit the motives for this
rewrite is interesting for other open source maintainers in the same situation
as me. This all started when I wanted to use a Rust Spotify API wrapper for one
of my projects at that time, https://vidify.org/[Vidify]. I went to
https://crates.io/[crates.io] and looked for "Spotify", and all I found was {{<
crate rspotify >}} (the most popular one at that time), {{< crate aspotify >}} (
an asynchronous-only alternative), and a bunch of other outdated or incomplete
libraries.

The author of `aspotify` had made a brand new library from scratch, because as
he commented in its release, "`[rspotify's] API in general I found hard to use
and confusing`" <<aspotify-release>>. Honestly, depending on the state of the
original library this is the easiest choice because you don't have to worry
about backwards compatibility, old code, etc.

A year back I had also helped with the first steps of
https://github.com/felix-hilden/tekore[`tekore`], an alternative to
https://github.com/plamere/spotipy[`spotipy`], the most popular Spotify library
for Python out there. The problem was that back then, Paul, spotipy's creator
and maintainer, was absent <<spotipy-absent>>, and the library really needed a
push to upgrade from Python 2 and improve the overall interface and
user-friendliness, which had become pretty poor.

https://github.com/felix-hilden[Felix] and a few more devs tried to start from
scratch. Felix was the most dedicated one and eventually got permissions from
Paul to upload new spotipy releases, meaning that he could rewrite the entire
thing and upload it to PyPi (Python's official third-party repositories) if he
wanted to. The difference in this case was that spotipy had a good amount of
users at that point, and a couple of them ended up stopping Felix from
completely breaking backward compatibility, so he made it into a brand new
library instead and left the maintainance tasks to the new devs in charge.
Tekore still is, in my very biased opinion and at the time of this writing, a
much nicer to use library than spotipy, but it has taken a lot of time to get a
user base starting from scratch, and it's still not as popular as spotipy by
far.

Having gone through this, I also wanted to see if it would be possible to give
Rspotify a face wash without anyone complaining. Rspotify was still in beta --
version 0.10 -- so you can't expect to have a stable API, but that's far from a
full rewrite. At the very least I wanted to talk with Ramsay, the original
Rspotify developer, and see what his thoughts were. I proposed some big changes
like rewriting the `blocking` module <<gh-block-cleanup>> and
https://github.com/Kestrer[Kestrer] wrote up an issue with ~80 issues he had
found when using the library <<gh-meta>>.

I think it's fair to release the new version 0.11 as such rather than as a new
library because of the following reasons:

* Ramsay, the author, also wanted to help.
* The fundamentals of the library would remain the same: being the most
  user-friendly feature-full library for the Spotify API.
* It was considered a necessary evil. In my opinion, the library was doomed
  without a big rewrite. Otherwise it'd eventually become really hard to maintain and work
  with. I admit that said breaking changes could've been
  smaller, but I thought that while I'm at it I might as well make it as close
  as possible to a perfect Rust interface.

Also, note that I am in no way associated with Spotify (though open to offers
:P). I'm just a Computer Science student whose sole goal was to use Rust for a
non-trivial case, from start to finish. I was somewhat experienced with the
Spotify API, so I decided Rspotify was a good choice.

Now that most of the stuff I talk about in this article is finished, you can
read about the changes in detail
https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[in the
CHANGELOG]. The following sections will talk about what I learned about API
Design, and some tips for those writing one in Rust.

[[actual_start]]
== Making the API HTTP-client agnostic

Rspotify is now HTTP-client agnostic, which means that it can work with
whichever HTTP library the user configures without adding much overhead. For
now, we support {{< crate ureq >}} and {{< crate reqwest >}} <<gh-clients>>. The
non-trivial part about this is that the HTTP client can be either blocking
(`ureq`) or asynchronous (`reqwest`).

While it's fully implemented in the new version, it's the only part that isn't
finished yet and that's subject to change. This has to do with the way we
support both async and sync HTTP clients under the same trait. In order to have
a common interface for both kinds of programming, we use the {{< crate
maybe_async >}} crate, which lets us switch between them with a feature.

The trait used as a base for any HTTP client is implemented with async. That
way, if the `maybe_async/is_sync` feature is disabled in the `Cargo.toml`, the
trait and its implementations remain the same, and if it's enabled, all the
occurrences of `async` and `.await` are removed. It's also possible to add
special cases where removing `async`/`.await` isn't enough. This works
perfectly, but unfortunately breaks a rule in Cargo's feature system: features
must be strictly additive, and ``maybe_async``'s feature is a _toggle_ -- you
can't have both a sync and an async client at the same time.

Since we don't follow that rule, those who depend on Rspotify with both async
and async (directly or indirectly) won't be able to compile their project. I
won't get into much detail beacuse I'm writing an entire separate post dedicated
for this issue that I'll publish once this whole ordeal is fixed. We're keeping
track of it in https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/221[#221] for now,
for those who want to lean more.

For now, I'll just explain how it works for clients of the same type: either
synchronous or asynchronous. Since the usage for an HTTP client in an API is
often very basic, i.e. you only need to make requests and get the results, we
can cover its usage under a single interface. For example:

[source, rust]
----
pub trait HttpClient: Send + Default {
   type Error;

    fn get(
        &self,
        url: &str,
        headers: Option<&Headers>,
        payload: &Query,
    ) -> Result<String, Self::Error>;

    fn post(
        &self,
        url: &str,
        headers: Option<&Headers>,
        payload: &Value,
    ) -> Result<String, Self::Error>;
    
    // etc
}
----

Then, we can add an implementation for each of our supported clients:

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Default, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct UreqClient {}

impl HttpClient for UreqClient {
    type Error = ureq::Transport;

    #[inline]
    fn get(
        &self,
        url: &str,
        headers: Option<&Headers>,
        payload: &Query,
    ) -> Result<String, Self::Error> {
        let request = ureq::get(url);
        let sender = |mut req: Request| {
            for (key, val) in payload.iter() {
                req = req.query(key, val)
            }
            req.call()
        };
        self.request(request, headers, sender) // Internal more complex handler
    }

    // etc
}
----

And we can finally make our client generic over its internal HTTP client:

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Default, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Spotify<Http: HttpClient> {
    http: Http,
    // etc
}

impl<Http: HttpClient> Spotify<Http> {
    pub fn endpoint(&self) -> String {
        let headers = todo!();
        let payload = todo!();
        self.http.get("/some/endpoint", headers, payload)
    }
}
----

Beware that this introduces a good amount of additional complexity which is
probably unnecessary for your own API wrapper. But this was definitely something
interesting for Rspotify: some crates that already depend on us like
https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot[`ncspot`] or
https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd[`spotifyd`] are blocking, and others like
https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui[`spotify-tui`] use async. I thought I
might as well try, and I've finally figured out how to make it work, even for
both async and sync.

We implement all of this in the crate
https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/tree/master/rspotify-http[`rspotify-http`],
which I plan on https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/234[moving into a
separate crate] for the whole community to use once it's working as I want it
to. I think this is a pretty neat feature for an API client that will hopefully
become easier to implement in the future (and first of all work properly).

== Finding a more robust architecture

Another key refactor I worked on for Rspotify was its architecture. The Spotify
API in particular has
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/[multiple
authorization methods] that give you access to a different set of endpoints. For
example, if you're using _client credentials_ (the most basic one), then you
can't access an endpoint to modify the user's data; you need
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth[OAuth information]. This used to work with
the https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html[_builder
pattern_], following this structure (though not exactly the same):

[source, rust]
----
// OAuth information
let oauth = SpotifyOAuth::default()
    .redirect_uri("http://localhost:8888/callback")
    .scope("user-modify-playback-state")
    .build()
    .unwrap();

// Basic information
let creds = SpotifyClientCredentials::default()
    .client_id("this-is-my-client-id")
    .client_secret("this-is-my-client-secret")
    .build()
    .unwrap();

// Obtaining the access token
let token = get_token(&mut oauth).unwrap();

// The client itself
let spotify = Spotify::default()
    .client_credentials_manager(creds)
    .token_info(token)
    .build()
    .unwrap();

// Performing a request
spotify.seek_track(25000, None).unwrap();
----

I wanted something more tailored towards our specific application. I think the
builder pattern is great, but it might become too verbose or confusing:

* Do we really need it for `Credentials`, which always takes the same two
  parameters?
* Which authorization method are we using above again? Currently it's possible
  to call `seek_track` after having followed an authorization process that
  doesn't give access to it. And since we're mixing all of them under the same
  client it quickly becomes a mess, having many `Option<T>` fields that are only
  `Some` for specific authorization methods. So, what if we have a Spotify
  client for each authorization method?
* Wouldn't it be nice have some type safety, too? The `unwrap` hurts my eyes.

After removing the builder pattern and being more explicit about the
authorization method that's being used, this is more or less what we get:

[source, rust]
----
// OAuth information
let oauth = OAuth::new("http://localhost:8888/callback", "user-read-currently-playing");
// Basic information
let creds = Credentials::new("my-client-id", "my-client-secret");
// The client itself, now clearly with the "authorization code" method
let mut spotify = AuthCodeSpotify::new(creds, oauth);

// Obtaining the access token
spotify.prompt_for_token().unwrap();

// Performing a request
spotify.seek_track(25000, None).unwrap();
----

And if the user wants something more advanced, they can always write this:

[source, rust]
----
let oauth = OAuth {
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:8888/callback",
    state: generate_random_string(16, alphabets::ALPHANUM),
    scopes: "user-read-currently-playing",
    ..Default::default()
};
----

Using the regular initialization pattern is more than enough for this case
because we don't even need validation. If we did, we could always just add a few
setters or checks before its usage and we're done. Ask yourself: do you really
need the builder pattern? In this case we certainly didn't.

The most complicated part of the refactor is having a client for each
authorization method, and making sure the user can only call those endpoints
they have access to. There are _many_ ways to approach this, I just had to
decide which one was the best. I gave this a lot of thought <<gh-auth>>
<<reddit-auth>>.

Having multiple clients seems trivial with inheritance, with a base from which
they can extend. In Rust, we could follow the typical "`composition over
inheritance`" principle:

[source, rust]
----
pub struct EndpointsBase {
    http: Rc<Http> // Shared with the rest of the endpoints
}
impl EndpointsBase {
    pub fn endpoint1(&self) { self.http.get("/endpoint1") }
    pub fn endpoint2(&self) { self.http.get("/endpoint2") }
    // etc
}

pub struct EndpointsOAuth {
    token: Token,
    http: Rc<Http>
}
impl EndpointsOAuth {
    pub fn endpoint3(&self) { self.http.get_oauth("/endpoint3", self.token) }
    pub fn endpoint4(&self) { self.http.get_oauth("/endpoint4", self.token) }
    // etc
}

pub struct AuthCodeSpotify(EndpointsBase, EndpointsOAuth);
impl AuthCodeSpotify {
    pub fn authenticate(&self) { /* ... */ }

    pub fn base(&self) -> &EndpointsBase { &self.0 }
    pub fn oauth(&self) -> &EndpointsOAuth { &self.1 }
}
----

The user can then write `spotify.base().endpoint1()` or
`spotify.oauth().endpoint3()` to access the endpoints in their different groups.
However, all of them have to share a single HTTP client and other information
such as the config or the token, so we have to use something like `Rc`. We can
improve this by taking ideas from {{< crate aspotify >}}, another popular crate
for the Spotify API, which groups up the endpoints by categories. Their endpoint
groups take a reference to the client itself instead, which is pretty neat and
works just as well:

.https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=6cce195451518fcf644e7506ca7b51b2[Simplified from the working example on the Rust playground]
[source, rust]
----
pub trait Spotify {
    fn get_http(&self) -> &Http;
    fn get_token(&self) -> &Token;
}

pub struct EndpointsBase<'a, S: Spotify>(&'a S);
impl<S: Spotify> EndpointsBase<'_, S> {
    pub fn endpoint1(&self) { self.0.get_http().get("/endpoint1") }
    pub fn endpoint2(&self) { self.0.get_http().get("/endpoint2") }
    // etc
}

pub struct EndpointsOAuth<'a, S: Spotify>(&'a S);
impl<S: Spotify> EndpointsOAuth<'_, S> {
    pub fn endpoint3(&self) { self.0.get_http().get_oauth("/endpoint3", self.0.get_token()) }
    pub fn endpoint4(&self) { self.0.get_http().get_oauth("/endpoint4", self.0.get_token()) }
    // etc
}

pub struct AuthCodeSpotify {
    pub http: Http,
    pub token: Token
}
impl Spotify for AuthCodeSpotify {
    fn get_http(&self) -> &Http { &self.http }
    fn get_token(&self) -> &Token { &self.token }
}
impl AuthCodeSpotify {
    pub fn authenticate(&self) { /* ... */ }

    pub fn base(&self) -> EndpointsBase<'_, Self> { EndpointsBase(self) }
    pub fn oauth(&self) -> EndpointsOAuth<'_, Self> { EndpointsOAuth(self) }
}
----

However, you might personally think using just `spotify.endpoint1()` instead of
`spotify.base().endpoint1()` is more suitable for your particular API client.
The only way to do that would be to delegate every single endpoint manually into
the main client. Some people use `Deref` and `DerefMut` in order to
automatically do it, but that's a common anti-pattern <<deref-antipattern>>.

I tried different approaches, and my favorite ended up being a trait-based
interface. All you need is a couple traits with the endpoint implementations
which require a getter to the HTTP client or similars:

.https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=901e41d16172e17368328c5a7744f673[Simplified from the working example on the Rust playground]
[source, rust]
----
pub trait EndpointsBase {
    fn get_http(&self) -> &Http;

    fn endpoint1(&self) { self.get_http().get("/endpoint1") }
    fn endpoint2(&self) { self.get_http().get("/endpoint2") }
    // etc
}

pub trait EndpointsOAuth: EndpointsBase {
    fn get_token(&self) -> &Token;

    fn endpoint3(&self) { self.get_http().get_oauth("/endpoint3", self.get_token()) }
    fn endpoint4(&self) { self.get_http().get_oauth("/endpoint4", self.get_token()) }
    // etc
}

pub struct AuthCodeSpotify(Http, Token);
impl AuthCodeSpotify {
    pub fn authenticate(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
impl EndpointsBase for AuthCodeSpotify {
    fn get_http(&self) -> &Http { &self.0 }
}
impl EndpointsOAuth for AuthCodeSpotify {
    fn get_token(&self) -> &Token { &self.1 }
}
----

This way, as long as the user has these traits in scope, they can access the
endpoints with just `spotify.endpoint1()`. We can make that easier by including
a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36384840/what-is-the-prelude[prelude] in
the library with these traits, so that all the user has to do is `use
rspotify::prelude::*`.

The main issue with the trait-based solution is that you can't use `\-> impl
Trait` in trait methods as of Rust 1.55 <<trait-ret-impl>>. We unfortunately
need these, specially with asynchronous clients, because async trait methods are
`\-> impl Future` after all. For now, we can work around it by erasing the types
with the {{< crate async-trait >}} crate. Supposedly, this will be temporary
until GATs are implemented, which isn't too far off <<gats>>.

Both of these solutions also make it hard to have private functions in the base
client, because the shared parts are in a trait. We don't really want the user
to have access to the methods `get` or `get_oauth`. It's defined in the
client/trait because it's useful for every client, but for the end user it's
just noise in the documentation. This isn't that much of a big deal because you
can just declare the item with `#[doc(hidden)]` so that it doesn't appear in the
documentation.

So yeah, there are no _perfect_ solutions, but these are two of the best ones I
could find. The choice is up to the designer of the library and their needs.
Having multiple clients let us implement PKCE Authentication for Rspotify quite
easily <<gh-pkce>>, so it's worth it in the end anyway. Our final architecture
looks like this:

.Diagram by Ramsay
image::/blog/web-api-client/trait_hierarchy.png[align=center]

== Configuration

=== Runtime over compile-time

There are a few parts of the Spotify client that can be customized by the user.
Previously, these were just fields of the main client, but since we now have
multiple clients, it might be worth moving into a separate struct to avoid
duplication.

Anyhow, one of our fails was attempting to use features instead of the `Config`
struct for configuration, on the assumption that features would be more
performant:

.Which is faster?
[source, rust]
----
if self.config.cached_token {
    println!("Saving cache token to the file!");
}

#[cfg(feature = "cached_token")]
{
    println!("Saving cache token to the file!");
}
----

Turns out that both of these are usually compiled to the same machine code
anyway. Since `self.config.cached_token` is most times specified as a constant,
optimizing it away is one of the more basic tasks a compiler can do. Features
are drastically less flexible and harder to use than runtime variables, so
before introducing one you should really think about it. Apart from the fact
that you obviously can't use features at runtime (which is a possible use-case
here), they are applied globally, so you can't have two different clients, one
with cached tokens and another without them. In order to take this decision I
actually wrote an entire article about it, so
https://nullderef.com/blog/rust-features/[check it out if you want more
details].

Even though it's basic, I keep forgetting about this: don't get obsessed with
performance. As you add new features to the crate, it's completely natural that
some overheads are introduced here and there. And even then, they might not even
be noticeable. First of all get that new feature working. Then, measure the
actual effect on performance. And finally, if it's more than you expected, then
actually think about optimizing it.

One correct usage would be our new `cli` feature. We have some utilities for
command-line programs, such as prompting for the user's credentials. However,
not everyone needs these, such as servers, and it introduced the {{< crate
webbrowser >}} dependency and a few unecessary functions. So we decided to move
this into a separate feature for those interested, which is disabled by default.

=== Sane defaults

On the topic of configuration, it's important to have sane defaults as well.
This is highly subjective, but I prefer to do as little as possible under the
hood _without the user knowing about it_. When initializing a client we used to
automatically try to read from the environment variables, and if that didn't
work then we tried to use the default values or we just panicked in the builder:

[source, rust]
----
let creds = SpotifyClientCredentials::default() // this reads the env variables
    .client_id("this-is-my-client-id")
    .client_secret("this-is-my-client-secret")
    .build()
    .unwrap();
----

This is a pretty useful feature, but we can't be sure the writer/reader of the
code knows about it, and it could potentially cause cause unintended behaviour.
Instead, we can just have a `default` method that does nothing special, which is
what the user would expect, and also `from_env`, which _explicitly_ tells us
what it does:

[source, rust]
----
let creds = SpotifyClientCredentials::from_env() // this reads the env variables
    .client_id("this-is-my-client-id")
    .client_secret("this-is-my-client-secret")
    .build()
    .unwrap();
----

== Flexibility

=== Taking borrowed/generic parameters

Friendly reminder: generally, it's better to take a `&str` than a `String` in a
function <<str-param>> <<gh-iterators>>. The same thing applies to the owned
type `Vec<T>`; it's probably a better idea to take a `&[T]` instead, or the even
more fancy `impl IntoIterator<Item = T>`. The last option makes it possible to
pass iterators to the function without requiring a `collect`, which not only is
more user friendly, but also avoids a memory allocation. Its only downside is
that the function signatures become a bit uglier, and all the consequences of
using generics. Either of these options are fine, really, so it's up to you.

=== Optional parameters

Similarly, if the functions your library frequently include optional parameters
(i.e. of type `Option<T>`), you might want to consider other ways to handle
them. In our case, we were using generics with `Into<Option<T>>` in order to not
have to wrap the parameters in `Some` when passing them to the function, but it
wasn't consistent. We finally agreed that using plain `Option<T>` was good
enough because it simplifies the function definition in the docs and it's less
magic <<gh-optional-params>>. But the important part is that we made it
_consistent_; the decision itself between `Into<Option<T>>` or `Option<T>`
wasn't that important. After doing research about this topic, I wrote up an
article with more details https://nullderef.com/blog/rust-parameters/[here], in
case you want to learn more.

=== Splitting up into multiple crates

Another cool idea that promotes flexibility is separating the wrapper into
multiple crates. In Rspotify, we now have a total of four of them:

* `rspotify-http`: the multi-HTTP client abstraction, which I plan on making
  more generic and moving into a separate crate for everyone to use
  <<gh-http-universal>>
* `rspotify-macros`: a small crate with macros
* `rspotify-model`: the full model for the Rspotify crate
* `rspotify`: the implementation of the clients

.Diagram by Ramsay
image::/blog/web-api-client/crate_hierarchy.png[align=center]

The most important one here is splitting up the wrapper into the model and the
clients. The model is generic enough that it can be used by any client, even
outside of Rspotify. Some users have to implement their own custom clients for
different reasons, and pulling our model helps avoiding lots of complexity and
maintainance work <<model-separation>>. It can also be shared with other public
crates, such as `aspotify`, and join forces in keeping the model up to date
<<gh-aspotify-share>>.

== Documentation

=== Introducing how to use the crate

This might be obvious to some, but it isn't enough to document every single
public item in your library. You also have to introduce the user how to work
with it in the top-level documentation. Some ideas:

* List the goals, current and future features of the crate, and things you don't
  plan working on. Perhaps also add a comparison with similar crates; these are
  usually super helpful.
* Write a small getting started guide, explaining the most important items in
  the crate and what they do.
* Add some notes about the architecture of your crate. This is specially useul
  to those who want to contribute. For Rspotify, Ramsay created the diagrams
  included in this article, and added more details in the
  https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/blob/master/README.md[README].
* Explain the Cargo features in your crate and how to use them.
* Make sure you have a few examples working. It's the easiest way to get
  started, in my opinion.

=== Helping users upgrade

Since this change was going to break so much code, I wanted to make sure that
the upgrade is as less painful as possible. This can be achieved in many ways:

* Make sure you prove why these breaking changes are actually necessary. It will
  feel like less of a waste of time to the user.
* Include a
  https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[changelog],
  either as an indepent file, or in the release notes. In Rspotify, we make
  habit of adding a new line to the changelog for every release that includes a
  new feature or breaking changes. To be honest, in our case it's turned out
  quite messy because we had _so many changes_, but in a regular update it
  should be nicer to read.
* It might be a good idea to
  https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/218[create an issue in your
  repository] where you provide help directly to those who try to upgrade and
  have problems with it.

== Macros

Macros in Rust are pretty cool! But you don't want to overdo them either. In
`rspotify` we frequently had to build hashmaps or JSON objects; at least once
per endpoint. Some of the parameters in the endpoints were mandatory, and others
optional (passed as an `Option`):

[source, rust]
----
let mut params = Query::with_capacity(3);
params.insert("ids", ids);
params.insert("limit", limit.to_string());
if let Some(ref market) = market {
    params.insert("market", market.as_ref());
}
----

I first tried to simplify this by using macros to their full strength, so my
initial attempts looked like this:

[source, rust]
----
let params = build_map! {
    ids,
    limit => limit.to_string(),
    optional market => market.as_ref(),
};
----

Or this:

[source, rust]
----
let params = build_map! {
    ids,
    limit => limit.to_string(),
    Some(market) => market.as_ref()
};
----

Yes, they are _very_ concise and we remove a lot of boilerplate, but they're bad
for two reasons:

* There's too much magic going on:
** They turn the `ids`/`limit`/`market` identifiers into a string with
   https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.stringify.html[`stringify!`] and use that
   as the key for the hashmap insertion.
** In the expression to the right of an optional parameter, its value isn't
   treated as an `Option` anymore; there's a hidden `if let Some(market)`.
* The syntax is weird. In order to understand them correctly, you'd probably
  have to look up their documentation and read it first.

The final design <<gh-macros>> still reduces the boilerplate needed in each
endpoint considerably, but there's no magic going on. It's basically the same as
a regular hashmap builder macro like you'd find on
https://docs.rs/maplit/1.0.2/maplit/[`maplit`], and the macro doesn't hide
anything:

[source, rust]
----
let params = build_map! {
    "ids": ids,
    "limit": limit.to_string(),
    optional "market": market.map(|x| x.as_ref()),
};
----

Anyhow, we might remove it in the future, since this syntax will soon work as
well <<hashmap-new>>:

[source, rust]
----
HashMap::from([
  (k1, v1),
  (k2, v2)
]);
----

== Other goodies

Some new features we added to Rspotify that might be of interest specifically
for other web API wrappers:

=== Cached and self-refreshing tokens

Cached tokens are automatically saved into a file, encoded for example in JSON,
and then attempted to be loaded again when restarting the application.

Before making a request, self-refreshing tokens check if they are expired, and
in that case perform the re-authorization process automatically.

[.text-center]
{{< gh issue "ramsayleung/rspotify" 233 "Implement cache token and refresh token" >}} 

=== Type-safe wrappers for ID types

In the Spotify API, items such as artists or tracks are identified by a unique
ID string. The URI is the ID, but prefixed by its type, for example
`spotify:track:4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT`.

Many endpoints previously took the URI parameters as a String. That meant we had
to manually check that their type were what we were expecting, and also that
they were valid (they're usually made up of alphanumeric characters).

Instead, we now have an `Id` trait and structs that implement it, like
`ArtistId` or `TrackId`, keeping its type known at compile time and also at
runtime with `dyn Id`. If you take a `TrackId` as a parameter, then you already
know its type, and that its contents are valid, so you're ready to use it.

[.text-center]
{{< gh pr "ramsayleung/rspotify" 161 "Initial id type proposal" >}} and
{{< gh pr "ramsayleung/rspotify" 244 "Fix IDs v4" >}}

=== Automatic pagination

Many API servers have paginated replies for large lists. Instead of sending a
huge object, it splits it up into multiple packets, and sends them one by one
along with an index to the position in the list. Then, the user can stop
requesting them at any time and potentially only end up using a portion of that
originally huge object.

In Rust, this can be abstracted away very naturally with
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html[iterators] in sync
programs, and
https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/05_streams/01_chapter.html[streams] for
async. The latter can be implemented easily in your crate thanks to {{< crate
async_stream >}}.

[.text-center]
{{< gh issue "ramsayleung/rspotify" 124 "Add unlimited endpoints" >}}

=== Simplify wrapper model objects

Due to how JSON works, sometimes an object will always have a single field:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "many_artists": [
        {
            // ..
        },
        // ...
    ]
}
----

In that case, instead of just deserializing that object with {{< crate serde >}}
and returning it to the user, you can just return that one field in the object:

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ArtistCollection {
    many_artists: Vec<Artists>
}

// Before
fn endpoint() -> Result<ArtistCollection> {
    let response = request();
    serde_json::from_str(response)
}

// After
fn endpoint() -> Result<Vec<Artists>> {
    let response = request();
    serde_json::from_str::<ArtistCollection>(response).map(|x| x.many_artists)
}
----

== Measuring the changes

Since this release changed so much stuff and took so long, I wanted to get a
detailed comparison between v0.10 and v0.11 for different aspects of the
library -- not just performance.

The full source for these benchmarks is available at the
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/rspotify-bench[marioortizmanero/rspotify-bench]
repository. Note that I had to apply a small patch to the v0.10 version because
by now it didn't work correctly.

=== Statistics

Some parts of Rspotify can be analyzed statically, such as the lines of code
that will need to be maintained, or its number of dependencies:

.Results example as of 2021-10-12
|===
|Version |Rust LoC |Dependencies in tree |Dependencies in tree (all features)

|0.10.0 |11281 |132 |141

|master |7525 |101 |123
|===

The Lines of Code in the old version were quite bloated because of the
`blocking` module, which was a copy-paste of the async client. Still, these were
lines that needed to be maintained, so they count just as much. On the other
hand, we now have a much more extensive set of tests and new features that add
up. In total, we have about 33% less lines to be maintained in total.

The number of dependencies has decreased both by default and with all of the
features enabled. We cleaned up a lot of them and tried to keep the defaults
leaner <<gh-cleanup>>. Since the new version adds more features such as PKCE, we
even had to add new dependencies like {{< crate sha2 >}}, but it's still a clear
win.

=== Execution time

The execution benchmarks use
https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs[Criterion], with a total of 100
iterations on my Dell Vostro 5481 laptop, or more specifically, Intel i5-8265U
(8) @ 3.900GHz. The full reports are available in the `report` directory of each
benchmark.

Taking a look at the Criterion reports, it seems that the Spotify API doesn't
intentionally slow down responses when it's being "`spammed`", so it should be
fine in that regard:

image::/blog/web-api-client/iterations.png[align=center]

Note that comparing the blocking clients for now is unfair, because instead of
using `reqwest::blocking`, now it's `ureq`. Furthermore, the async and sync
versions can't be compared either, because the former requires setting up the
tokio runtime and a bunch of other stuff.

The asynchronous clients in both versions should give a rough idea of the actual
differences, though you can tell it's just a quick benchmark; the results
shouldn't be taken too seriously in the first place:

.Results example as of 2021-10-12
[width="100%",cols="^16%,^16%,^17%,^16%,^15%,^20%",options="header",]
|===
|Version |Debug Compilation Time (s) |Release Compilation Time (s)
|Benchmarking Time (ms/iter) |Release Binary Size (MB) |Release Stripped
Binary Size (MB)
|0.10.0, blocking |72.712 |126.229 |271.31 |9.9 |4.9

|0.10.0, async |72.244 |115.703 |428.02 |11 |5.2

|master, blocking (ureq) |38.549 |55.934 |503.68 |7.3 |2.6

|master, async (reqwest) |51.014 |86.594 |432.49 |8.5 |4.0
|===

I also wanted to reflect the compilation time, since it's a possibility that we
have less dependencies, but of larger size. The results show that this isn't the
case, since it takes 29% less time to build in debug mode, and 25% less time in
release mode.

In terms of execution time, I didn't expect it to be any better. Even though the
architecture and implementation is cleaner, some of the new features introduce
noticeable overhead. For example, now that we have automatically refreshing
tokens, the `Token` has to be saved in an `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, which means we're
locking and unlocking at least once per request. Still, the difference is almost
negligible: just a 1% increase.

The cleanup and all these dependencies we removed mean that the resulting binary
is also smaller, and by a lot: there's a 23% decrease in its size.

I'm specially grateful towards Ramsay, who apart from contributing many of the
features I listed here, read and reviewed _every single one of my issues and
pull requests_. I've learned how important it is to have a second opinon, and
someone else who proofreads everything before you merge dumb stuff into
`master`. Note that I _did_ proofread my own ideas and pull requests, but
there's some things that you just don't realize on time, as much as you try to.
This is a problem that I think is particularly relevant in open source. I
personally had worked on projects alone most of the times, and the difference is
huge. I would suggest everyone to try to join forces with at least one more
person when working in side projects.

That's all! I hope this post provided insightful information and that you
learned something from it. Remember that you can leave a comment at the bottom
in case you want to discuss about it.

Lots of love, +
Mario
