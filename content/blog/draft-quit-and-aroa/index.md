Aroa passing away both changed my physical world and my perspective. It'd be foolish to say it wasn't an influence on me quitting my job topursue entrepreneurship. The first thing a therapist may tell you is not to make big life decisions after an event like this, so I took it seriously. I tried to understand whether that was my case.

She passed away in Nov 23, and I gave my three months notice in Aug 24, so around 9 months. Is that enough waiting? I don't know. For something so eventful, probably not, as it takes years to process it. If I can fully understand what "processing" it means, anyway.

But what am I supposed to do during the years it may take me to "process it"? Not many any decisions? What felt important to me was the fact that the decision wasn't that bad for me. Sure, I was leaving a really good job with excellent pay and 30+ vacation days. But it had already felt unfulfilling for a long time, even before my sister passed. And pursuing entrepreneurship wasn't anything new, either.

In uni, I always had several side projects going on, which I dearly enjoyed. First, it didn't make sense to me to do one of them full time before I got some industry experience. No regrets, the experience was definitely very appreciated. Not just to learn as much as I did, but also to truly learn if industry is something I enjoyed.

Second, a big reason why I was afraid to pursue entrepreneurship was fear of losing my life to it. As in, not being present for others, and missing out on other important parts of life simply because I'm obsessed with this stupid project. I was very passionate about them -- to much. At times, it took over everything else I was doing: socializing, enjoying my free time from studying, or enjoying university life. I've also had local entrepreneurs beside me in my family and saw similar struggles. My father owns a bar that gave him a livelihood but also many pains and endless stress, with reasons of working way too many hours and being able to disconnect. It wasn't uncommon that he'd finally take a break and go cycling with me, only to get a call that the washing machine had broken and he should go there resolve it. Not that these kind of businesses are 1:1 with tech, but it made me wary.

In my case, I felt 9 months after the event were enough. Being young, feeling stuck sucks because of the pressure that you're supposed to be doing lots of things and learning. Death also makes you more aware that you have to enjoy the one life you're given.

Something I've learned is that my subconscious hides many things from me. My mind and thoughts are in order, but there's something deep inside my brain that's troubled. It's hard to know what's the root cause of me wanting to quit my job -- what's deep there hiding? It might be that I feel bad for not being close enough with Aroa (even if she told me I helped her), and I'm trying to make it up for it with a startup that's "good for the world". Maybe? But honestly, who cares if that's the case? Doing this isn't bad for me. I'm not harming myself as if I was dealing with it through alcohol or toxic behavior. I was in a situation where quitting felt right (in fact, much better than later on if I want to have kids). And I'm approaching it from a healthy perspectie. I don't want to work all the time -- it's one of my principles since the very beginning. I'm exploring, learning, and giving a shot at something I've wanted to for a long time.

I'm also very open to working for someone else in the future, to be clear. I'm not trying to say "corporate sucks". Just that having a feeling of purpose is more important to me than I t hought. I'll probably work for someone else at some point in the future. Just not because it was the offer that pays most -- which is how it went with Lyft, to be honest. I'll care about my meaning and what I'm working towards. Money beyond a decent living is weird to me.
