:sectnums:

_Subtyping and variance_ is a concept that works in the background, making your
life easier without you knowing about it. That is, until it starts making your
life harder instead. It's a good idea to know about it, in case you end up being
a fool like me. So let's take a look at what went wrong, and how it was
resolved.

== The problem

As part of my https://nullderef.com/series/rust-plugins/[Plugin System in Rust]
series, I was making one of https://www.tremor.rs/[Tremor]'s types
FFI-compatible. Put simply, instead of using types from the standard library
like `String`, we wanted custom types defined
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprc[with `#[repr\(C)\]`].
The crate {{< crate abi_stable >}} exists for this exact purpose, with an
equivalent for the most important types. Theoretically, the task should be as
easy as changing the `std` types in our core `enum` with theirs:

.Before (simplified)
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
pub enum Value {
    String(String),
    Object(Box<HashMap<String, Value>>),
    Bytes(Vec<u8>),
}
{{< /highlight >}}

.After (simplified)
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
use abi_stable::std_types::{RString, RVec, RBox, RHashMap};

#[repr(C)]
pub enum Value {
    String(RString),
    Object(RBox<RHashMap<RString, Value>>),
    Bytes(RVec<u8>),
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The `Value` type is used a lot in the codebase, so this breaking change brought
up lots of compilation errors. But for whatever reason, 70 of these errors were
related to lifetimes, which I hadn't changed at all...

== Debugging

Instead of a `String` or `Vec`, we actually used
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc/borrow/enum.Cow.html[`Cow<'a>`] for
performance reasons. `Cow<'a>` is a type that can hold either a borrowed or an
owned value at runtime. The idea is to use the borrowed one as much as possible,
and only if ownership or mutation is needed, the underlying value is cloned
(https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/v1z6bx/what_is_a_cow/iape1qq/[a better
explanation can be found here]).

https://mastodon.social/@heinz[Heinz], my mentor at Tremor, managed to reproduce
the issue to `Cow` and its equivalent, `RCow`.
https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=660f8633738fd0a8817cc8ee9bbddfa8[A
Playground snippet can be found here].

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
use abi_stable::std_types::RCow;
use std::borrow::Cow;

// This works
fn cmp_cow<'a, 'b>(left: &Cow<'a, ()>, right: &Cow<'b, ()>) -> bool {
    left == right
}

// This fails to compile
fn cmp_rcow<'a, 'b>(left: &RCow<'a, ()>, right: &RCow<'b, ()>) -> bool {
    left == right
}
{{< /highlight >}}

It failed to compile with the following error, which didn't help much. In Rust
1.62.0, they actually improved it to explain what's going on (shown at the end
of the article):

{{< highlight "text" >}}
$ cargo b

   |                            |
   |                            these two types are declared with different lifetimes...

What? Why do lifetimes matter here if it's just a comparison?

This hinted that the issue was in the underlying library, not my code. `RCow` is
supposed to be a drop-in replacement for `Cow`. It also had something to do with
`PartialOrd`, which is the trait used for `==` here. But I couldn't see a
difference in its implementations:

.Cow
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<'a, B: ?Sized> PartialOrd for Cow<'a, B>
where
    B: PartialOrd + ToOwned,
{
    #[inline]
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Cow<'a, B>) -> Option<Ordering> {
        PartialOrd::partial_cmp(&**self, &**other)
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

.RCow
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<'a, B> PartialOrd<RCow<'a, B>> for RCow<'a, B>
where
    B: PartialOrd + BorrowOwned<'a> + ?Sized,
{
    #[inline]
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &RCow<'a, B>) -> Option<Ordering> {
        PartialOrd::partial_cmp(&**self, &**other)
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

There are more libraries providing drop-in replacements for `Cow`. And for
example, {{< crate "beef" >}} managed to get it right, somehow. I wasn't able to
reproduce the issue with their version... but why?

.Beef's Cow
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<A, B, U, V> PartialOrd<Cow<'_, B, V>> for Cow<'_, A, U>
where
    A: Beef + ?Sized + PartialOrd<B>,
    B: Beef + ?Sized,
    U: Capacity,
    V: Capacity,
{
    #[inline]
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Cow<'_, B, V>) -> Option<Ordering> {
        PartialOrd::partial_cmp(self.borrow(), other.borrow())
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

== Some progress... or not?

Other traits like `PartialEq` also caused similar lifetime errors. I was able to
fix some by introducing a new lifetime `'b` into the trait implementation. This
indicated the Rust compiler that comparing objects with different lifetimes is
okay:

{{< highlight "diff" >}}
-impl<'a, B> PartialEq<RCow<'a, B>> for RCow<'a, B>
+impl<'a, 'b, B, C> PartialEq<RCow<'b, C>> for RCow<'a, B>
 where
     B: PartialEq + BorrowOwned<'a> + ?Sized,
+    C: BorrowOwned<'b> + ?Sized,
 {
-    fn eq(&self, other: &RCow<'a, B>) -> bool {
+    fn eq(&self, other: &RCow<'b, C>) -> bool {
         PartialEq::eq(&**self, &**other)
     }
 }
{{< /highlight >}}

I suddenly got a bit of hope. But this could never work for `Ord`, which also
failed. The `Ord` trait uses `Self` instead of another generic type, so I can't
just introduce a new lifetime:

.Cow
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<B: ?Sized> Ord for Cow<'_, B>
where
    B: Ord + ToOwned,
{
    #[inline]
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        Ord::cmp(&**self, &**other)
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

.RCow
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<'a, B: ?Sized> Ord for RCow<'a, B>
where
    B: Ord + BorrowOwned<'a>,
{
    #[inline]
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        Ord::cmp(&**self, &**other)
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

== Discovering the root cause

Some wonderful people on the Rust Discord server helped me understand what was
going on. So I started learning more about the so-called "`Subtyping and
Variance`".

image::discord.png[Discord discussion, width=100%, align=center]

This topic isn't covered in https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/[The Rust Book].
We'll only find it in its more obscure, unsafer brother, The Rustonomicon. This
book explains it incredibly well, so I won't repeat it here. Here are some
resources:

. https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html["`Subtyping and Variance`" --
  The Rustonomicon] (_an explanation_)
. https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/subtyping.html["`Subtyping and Variance`"
  -- The Rust Reference] (_a cheatsheet_)
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)["`Covariance
  and contravariance`" -- Wikipedia] (_the general term_)

A couple blog posts take a more practical approach, like
https://medium.com/@orbitalK/rust-lifetime-subtype-variance-b58434fe36ed["`Rust
Lifetime Subtype Variance`" -- Prolific K] or
https://lcnr.de/blog/diving-deep-implied-bounds-and-variance/["`Diving Deep:
implied bounds and variance`" -- lcnr.de]. Or if you're a visual learner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVYWDIW71jk[this video from Jon Gjengset] might
be best for you.

== Trying to fix it

The difference between `RCow` and `Cow` was the `BorrowOwned<'a>` trait. For
technical reasons, it was being used as a
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/supertraits.html[subtrait] of
`ToOwned`, and it had to bind to a lifetime `'a`. Ultimately, this made `RCow`
_invariant_ over `'a`, while `Cow` was _covariant_. We want `RCow` to be
_covariant_ for this to work.

{{< highlight "diff" >}}
 impl<B: ?Sized> Ord for Cow<'a, B>
 where
-    B: Ord + ToOwned,  // in Cow
+    B: Ord + BorrowOwned<'a>,  // in RCow
 {
     #[inline]
     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
         Ord::cmp(&**self, &**other)
     }
 }
{{< /highlight >}}

=== Attempt #1: GATs

I had an idea of using
https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization.html[Generic Associated
Types (GATs)]. Instead of binding the lifetime to the trait, I could do so to
its associated type. Then, I'd be able to use `BorrowOwned` instead of
`BorrowOwned<'a>`:

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl<T> BorrowOwned for T {
    type RBorrowed<'a> where T: 'a = &'a T;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

But
https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/variance.html#variance-and-associated-types[a
section in the Rust Developer Book] states that "`traits with associated types
must be invariant with respect to all of their inputs`". So that still didn't
help make our type covariant.

Note I only found that statement in the book for developers of the compiler! I
opened https://github.com/rust-lang/nomicon/issues/338[an issue about that in
The Rustonomicon], and moved on to something else.

=== Attempt #2: `transmute`

After many wasted hours, I was tempted to use `transmute` and call it a day.
Here's what Heinz suggested (_trigger warning_):

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
fn compare<'a, 'b>(left: &RCow<'a, str>, right: &RCow<'b, str>) -> Ordering {
    unsafe {
        let right: &RCow<'a, str> = std::mem::transmute(right);
        left.cmp(right)
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

It worked! In theory, it's safe because both `'a` and `'b` will live for at
least as long as the function does, and we're returning an owned type.

Ideally, we'd abstract it away by writing a wrapper around `RCow` with the fix.
But that wouldn't help because invariant relationships are inherited, and the
wrapper's implementation of `Ord` would still use `BorrowOwned<'a>`.

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
struct SCow<'a>(RCow<'a, ()>);  // will still be invariant!
{{< /highlight >}}

One workaround would be to hide `RCow` under a `*const ()`. Then, I can
pointer-cast back and forth from it. But in this project, I already had too many
things backfire. Traumatized, I continued looking for a solution.

=== Attempt #3: getting rid of `BorrowOwned<'a>`

The best way to not have problems with this trait is to get rid of it. The
standard library has `ToOwned`, which links a borrowed type with its owned
counterpart. For example, `&str` and `String`. If `Cow<B>` requires `B:
ToOwned`, then the `Cow::Borrowed` variant can be just hold `&B` and
`Cow::Owned` can hold `B::Owned`.

`BorrowOwned<'a>` roughly did the same thing for types defined in `abi_stable`,
such as `RStr` and `RString`:

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
// standard library
let x: &str = "abc";
let x_owned: String = x.to_owned();

// abi_stable
let x_ffi_safe: RStr<'_> = rstr!("abc");
let x_owned: String = x.to_owned();
let x_ffi_safe_owned: RString = x.r_to_owned();
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that we need a lifetime in `BorrowOwned` because the equivalent of `&'a
str` is `RStr<'a>`. Which is not exactly the same. This is because `str` is a
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#dynamically-sized-types-dsts[Dynamically
Sized Type (DST)], but custom DSTs aren't supported by Rust.

{{< highlight "rust" >}}
impl ToOwned for str {  // okay
    type Owned = String;
    // `&self` is `&str`
    fn to_owned(&self) -> String { ... }
}

impl ToOwned for RStr {
    type Owned = RString;
    // `&self` is `&RStr<'a>`, but we want `RStr<'a>`
    // So we can't quite use `ToOwned` here
    fn to_owned(&self) -> RString { ... }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

So instead of establishing this relationship through a trait, we can introduce a
new generic paramter `O`. `B` would be the borrowed type, and `O` the owned
one. This is similar to what the {{< crate "cervine" >}} crate does, which
relaxes the constraints of `Cow`:

.Before
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
#[repr(C)]
enum RCow<'a, B>
where
    B: BorrowOwned<'a> + ?Sized,
{
    Borrowed(<B as BorrowOwned<'a>>::RBorrowed),
    Owned(<B as BorrowOwned<'a>>::ROwned),
}
{{< /highlight >}}

.After
{{< highlight "rust" >}}
#[repr(C)]
enum RCow<B, O> {
    Borrowed(B),
    Owned(O),
}

/// Ffi-safe equivalent of `Cow<'a, T>`, either a `&T` or `T`.
type RCowVal<'a, T> = RCow<&'a T, T>;
/// Ffi-safe equivalent of `Cow<'a, str>`, either an `RStr` or `RString`.
type RCowStr<'a> = RCow<RStr<'a>, RString>;
/// Ffi-safe equivalent of `Cow<'a, [T]>`, either an `RSlice` or `RVec`.
type RCowSlice<'a, T> = RCow<RSlice<'a, T>, RVec<T>>;
{{< /highlight >}}

Without the `BorrowOwned` trait, our struct was now covariant over `'a`, and the
errors disappeared. https://github.com/rodrimati1992[Rodri], the author of
`abi_stable` ended up proposing
https://github.com/rodrimati1992/abi_stable_crates/commit/0b048ecf07177d1aa664a65d3a78fe5a2aba421e[the
fix that was merged]. You can find

simplified version here].

== Conclusion

This showcased two gaps in the language:

. There were no indications in the error message about the issue being related
  to "`variance`". I had no idea what that was, and it wasn't covered in the book.
. It was very hard to debug the variance of a type, given that they are
  implicit.

So it's amazing to hear that starting in Rust 1.62.0, you're even taken to the
documentation. It will still be hard to understand the whole topic, but at least
you know where to start!
