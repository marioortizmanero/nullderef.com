I never expected that quitting my first job would be so hard! My time at Lyft
has been awesome. Tons of smart people at three very different teams, where I've
learned how the industry works. The technical challenges were fun and endless.
Most recently, I was dealing with a complex C++/Go/Python stack for

routing of our drivers].

But after two years, I've realized that it just wasn't making me happy. My
disconnect with the product was too big, and so much remote work didn't help,
either. I wanted to explore -- maybe something else could bring me more
fulfillment.

I've always aspired to build a company, and this seemed like the right moment to
try. Now or never. So here I am, soon to be jobless, contemplating life, yet
excited about what's next.

My company might fail (in fact, the odds are against me). But I'll have tried
and learned! That makes me feel I'm making the best out of life, and it frees me
of regrets. Mostly. It's still pretty insane that I quit.

It's early in my journey, but I can't stop myself from exploring my area of
interest: phones. Or rather, phonesn't. Not having had the best year of my life,
I found myself on my phone too much. The negative effects became obvious, and I
want to do something about it.

It's an incredibly complex challenge. Everyone overuses their phone in their own
way. You have big companies _optimizing_ their app to get you stuck on it. And
often, overuse is a symptom of a deeper problem, so you'd be better off directly
fixing that.

Yet, it's such a huge issue that I'm confident I can build something valuable.
You don't need to be completely addicted to your phone to want to use it less.
Among the thousand possible ideas -- even

started with an innovative app to control screentime. It's frustrating that no
existing apps have gone mainstream. Let's make it fun to reduce your usage.
