I never expected that quitting my first job would be so hard! My time at Lyft
was awesome. I met smart people from very different teams and learned a lot
about the industry. The technical challenges were fun and endless. Most
recently, I was dealing with a complex C++/Go/Python stack for
https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyfts-secret-plan-to-take-control-of-its-maps-and-its-future[routing].

TODO: drawing of a map with a route, very wide. It could be me, wondering where
my next destination is.

But after two years, I realized my job just wasn't making me happy. There was a
disconnect with the product I couldn't overcome. And I was looking for something
more fulfilling.

I've always aspired to build a company. This seemed like the right moment to try
-- now or never. So here I am, soon to be jobless, contemplating life, yet
excited about what's next.

Maybe it will fail (in fact, the odds are against me). But I'll have tried and
learned! That makes me feel I'm making the best out of life, and it frees me of
regrets. Mostly. It's still pretty insane that I quit.

It's early in my journey, but I can't stop myself from exploring my area of
interest: phones. Or rather, phonesn't. Not having had the best year of my life,
I found myself on my phone too much. The negative effects became obvious, and I
want to do something about it.

It's an incredibly complex challenge. There are many ways to overuse your phone.
You have big companies _optimizing_ their app to get you stuck on it. And often,
overuse is a symptom of a deeper problem, so you'd be better off directly fixing
that.

Yet, it's such a huge issue that I'm confident I can build something valuable.
There are a thousand ideas out there -- even
https://nullderef.com/blog/phone-intro/[building your own phone]. I'm thinking
the best way to get started is an app to control screentime. It's frustrating
that no existing apps have gone mainstream -- let's make it fun to use your
phone less.
