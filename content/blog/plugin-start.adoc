== Introduction

Welcome to my second article about Plugins in Rust! Here I will try to actually
write some simple code of what a PDK would look like, and also do some research
about questions that arise while doing so. Please note that this is a series of
posts, so you might be interested in reading
https://nullderef.com/series/rust-plugins/[the previous ones for context].

Some probably weren't expecting me to continue the series, as in the
https://nullderef.com/blog/plugin-tech/[last article] I wrote that Google didn't
end up allocating a slot for my project (as this was initially going to be for
the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code]). But the Tremor
team ended up talking with me and arranging the same thing via the
https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/[The Linux Foundation
Mentorships], so I will be able to work on the PDK in the end!

Even though this project is specific to Tremor, I try to keep it relatively
generic so that it's useful to future rustaceans interested in plugins. If you
don't really care about Tremor's specific case, you can skip to the
<<actual_start,next section>>.

== About Tremor

=== Getting to know the team

My first official meeting with the Tremor team took place in the beginnings of
August. I had already been lurking in their Discord server before, and I'd
talked with them a few times, so I more or less knew what to expect. But I was
still surprised by their welcomingness and how refreshing their dynamics were.

Starting to work on Tremor for the first time with such a large task at first
sounds daunting. I was somewhat overwhelmed by that and felt quite some pressure
on me. But their words helped me de-stress about it; finishing the PDK would of
course be hard, but no need to worry about things you can't control yet.

I particularly liked the three "`rules`" of their workflow:

* Have fun
* Take good notes
* Don't worry

Matthias, Darach and Heinz seemed like very different kinds of people; something
they knew and took advantage of. Decision-taking is hard; it requires good
communication and an open mind. I also took note of this quote (roughly) from
them:

[quote, Darach]
____
When I have an idea about something, I just post it on the Discord server and
wait for it to be destroyed by someone else. If it doesn't, maybe it's worth
considering.
____

Also note that while writing this post I quite literally broke my leg (tibia &
fibula). The team was very supportive and I took some rest until I went through
surgery. Which is another reason as to why this article has taken me longer than
usual to release. Thanks a lot to all of them ❤️.

=== Getting to know other mentees

In the first reunion I was suggested to meet the other LFX mentee at that
moment, @aryan9600 on Discord, which seemed like a good idea. I'd seen him a
couple times and knew he'd been contributing to Tremor even before the
mentorship.

Aryan turned out to be a very nice colleague! He was very enthusiastic about the
project and he explained me his progress in detail. In summary, he was starting
to add gRPC support to Tremor, and wasn't sure how to approach it so that new
interfaces could be added outside the compilation time. He had multiple ideas on
how to implement this, but the one that interested me the most was via Wasm or
dynamic linking, which was exactly what I was trying to do as well for the PDK.
This meant I'd probably spend more time with him, as our projects were more
interconnected than I thought.

=== Learning about the internals of Tremor

I've always known that the original intent for the PDK was the typical
architecture via dynamic linking, but I wanted to explore the viability of Wasm
or other alternatives before ruling it out. Would this idea be destroyed by
someone in the end, or does it stand a chance? In order to know that I'd first
need to find more specific requisites by defining the basic interfaces of the
PDK. Which is very hard at first because you need to know more about the
internals of Tremor and how it works.

Luckily, Matthias spent the second meeting explaining me how Tremor works, with
the help of some drawings, taking a look at the code, and running it. He also
taught me the novel concept of a _connector_, which is just an abstraction over
both sources and sinks. The thing was that connectors were still Work In
Progress, and Matthias needed to know how the PDK would work to modify the
`Connector` interface -- mainly how to approach a plugin interface with
generics. Which is what I'll try to figure out in this article.

Back when I talked to Aryan we ended up asking ourselves the same exact things.
Turns out that the generated code with `tonic` for gRPC uses generics, which
might not be compatible with dynamic loading.

[[actual_start]]
== The first steps

Up until now I had mostly investigated about the
https://nullderef.com/blog/plugin-tech/[technologies] that could be used for the
PDK, but I was suggested that I should first take a look at how the interfaces
would actually look like. That way it would be easier to take the final decision
for the PDK's technology, according to the requirements for these interfaces. In
summary, the following question arose:

* Is it possible to use generics in the PDK?
* Otherwise, is it possible to use `dyn` in the PDK?
* If all else fails, what can be done to represent a "`generic`" trait object in
  the interface Tremor exports for plugins?

This meant I had to do more research. I spent a few days reading multiple
articles, but it's a rabbit hole 🐰! I would recommend the following ones:

// TODO add wasm articles?

  Loading & Plugins - michael-f-bryan.github.io]

As you can see, Michael F. Bryan has put a lot of effort into teaching how
dynamic loading works in Rust. Thanks a lot to him!

== Experimenting with plugins

=== Dynamic Loading

Firstly, I've created the
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/pdk-experiments[pdk-experiments] repository,
where I'll write various examples of how the PDK might work. The first one I've
created is in the
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/pdk-experiments/tree/master/dynamic-simple[`dynamic-simple`
directory], with a small example of how to dynamically load plugins with Rust.

We first need a common library, called `common`, which defines the interface
exported by the plugin so that the main binary may load it. In this case it's
just a function:

.`common/src/lib.rs`
[source, rust]
----
pub type MinFunction = fn(i32, i32) -> i32;
----

With it, the plugin crate may export its own implementation. In this case I'll
declare a `static` variable, but the example also showcases how `extern` may
work as well (which will end up being the better choice). The crate's value of
`crate-type` must be set to a
https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html[dynamic library]. Note that
`#[no_mangle]` is necessary so that the variable's name is known when loading it
from the main binary.

.`plugin-sample/src/lib.rs`
[source, rust]
----
#[no_mangle]
pub static plugin_function: MinFunction = min;

fn min(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a.min(b)
}
----

Finally, the main binary can load the library with
https://crates.io/crates/libloading[`libloading`], which requires a bit of
`unsafe`. I was looking forward to using a library other than `libloading`
because of how easy it seems to end up with undefined behaviour in that case. I
found out `sharedlib` was abandoned, as no commits had been made since 2017,
leaving https://crates.io/crates/dlopen[`dlopen`] as the only alternative. Which
was updated two years ago as well, but their GitHub repo seemed somewhat active.

But to keep things simple, for now I'll just use `libloading` for being the most
popular crate, and perhaps consider using `dlopen` in the future. In terms of
relevant features and performance they're pretty close anyway
<<dynload-comp>>.

.`src/main.rs`
[source, rust]
----
fn run_plugin(path: &str) -> Result<(), libloading::Error> {
    unsafe {
        let library = Library::new(path)?;
        let min = library.get::<*mut MinFunction>(b"plugin_function\0")?.read();
        println!("Running plugin:");
        println!("  min(1, 2): {}", min(1, 2));
        println!("  min(-10, 10): {}", min(-10, 10));
        println!("  min(2000, 2000): {}", min(2000, 2000));
    }

    Ok(())
}
----

Running it:

[source, commandline]
----
$ cd plugin-sample
$ cargo build --release
$ cd ..
$ cargo run --release -- plugin-sample/target/debug/libplugin_sample.so
Running plugin:
  min(1, 2): 1
  min(-10, 10): -10
  min(2000, 2000): 2000
----

Cool! This raises a few questions that I should learn more about:

. Many plugin tutorials use `extern "C"` for the exported function's type in the
  plugin. What exactly does that mean? Do we need it if the FFI is Rust-to-Rust?
  Would https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.extern.html[`extern "Rust"`] work
  any better?
. There are many different options to configure `crate-type` as a
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html[dynamic library]. What are
  they and which one should I choose?
. I faintly remember that `rlib` files are Rust-only objects with additional
  metadata for things like generics. Could that possibly work at runtime? As in,
  is there an equivalent to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model[COM] in Rust, or maybe
  like JAR files in Java?

=== 1. `extern` values

The `extern` keyword can be used to either declare function interfaces that Rust
code can call foreign code by, or to export Rust code <<extern>>. Its parameter
specifies what ABI it should use, of which the only interesting values in this
case are:

* `extern "Rust"`: for the Rust ABI
* `extern "C"`: for the default C compiler's ABI in your system

Though most tutorials use `export "C"`, `export "Rust"` is the best choice for
Rust-to-Rust FFI because with it one can easily export Rust-only features like
enums with data fields (at the cost of not being a stable ABI). Otherwise, we'd
get this error:

[source, text]
----
warning: `extern` fn uses type `EnumWithDataFields`, which is not FFI-safe
  --> src/lib.rs:24:50
   |
24 | pub extern "C" fn with_extern(a: i32, b: i32) -> EnumWithDataFields {
   |                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
   |
   = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default
   = help: consider adding a `#[repr(C)]`, `#[repr(transparent)]`, or integer `#[repr(...)]` attribute to this enum
   = note: enum has no representation hint
note: the type is defined here
  --> src/lib.rs:3:1
   |
3  | / pub enum EnumWithDataFields {
4  | |     A,
5  | |     B(i32),
6  | |     C
7  | | }
   | |_^
----

Note that the default value for the ABI is `"C"`, so `"Rust"` must be explicitly
specified always when using `extern`.

=== 2. `crate-type` values

There are https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html[two ways to configure
dynamic linking with the `crate-type` field] in the crate's `Cargo.toml`:

* `dylib`
* `cdylib`

Once again, this difference has to do with the ABIs in the dynamic library
<<dylib>>. `cdylib` is meant for linking into C/C++ programs, and `dylib` for
Rust ones. `cdylib` will strip away all functions that aren't publicly exported.
`dylib` means that `extern` isn't even needed; you just need to set the external
items as `pub`.

=== 3. `rlib` files

Also listed in the previous section, `rlib` is a value for `crate-type` that
might be of interest. `rlib` files are Rust *static* libraries, which can then
be imported with `extern crate crate_name` <<dylib>>. Since `rlib` files are
static libraries, they can't be loaded at runtime.

So here's a crazy idea: What if the `rlib` files were dynamically loaded as
plugins with the help of https://github.com/rust-lang/miri[MIRI]? I recently
learned about it, and quoting its official documentation:

[quote]
____
[MIRI is] an experimental interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate
representation (MIR). It can run binaries and test suites of cargo projects and
detect certain classes of undefined behavior.

#You can use Miri to emulate programs on other targets#, e.g. to ensure that
byte-level data manipulation works correctly both on little-endian and
big-endian systems.
____

Hmm. Could it possibly be used to interpret Rust code? In some way this would be
very similar to using WebAssembly, but theoretically with less friction, as MIR
is specific to Rust and plugin development would be as easy as in the case of
dynamic loading with Rust-to-Rust FFI. A few things to consider:

. *Is this even possible?*
+
The Rust compiler itself uses MIRI to evaluate constant expressions
<<miri-compiler>> via the
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/index.html[`rustc_mir`
crate]. But taking a quick look it seems to be created specifically for the
compiler, at a very low level, and without that much documentation. Plus, it's
nightly-only. It does seem possible, but I wasn't able to get a simple example
working.
. *Is MIR stable?*
+
MIR is unfortunately unstable <<miri-unstable>>, so we'd have the same
incompatibility problems between plugins and the main binary.
. *Is the overhead of MIRI worth it?*
+
Considering the previous answers, no, this approach doesn't seem like the right
tool for the job.

=== WebAssembly

I also tried to write a simple example of how plugins would work with
WebAssembly, which is available in the
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/pdk-experiments/tree/master/wasm-simple[`wasm-simple`
directory]. It took me considerably more effort to get running than with dynamic
linking, even following https://freemasen.com/blog/wasmer-plugin-pt-1/[Free
Masen's guide] and
https://docs.rs/wasmer-runtime/0.17.1/wasmer_runtime/[Wasmer's official
documentation]. But at least I didn't have to write that much `unsafe` (I still
needed some to load or store data from Wasm's virtual memory, which I'll explain
later on).

The following snippet is what the plugin would look like. Note that this time we
don't even consider using `static` to export the function. Wasm does have
support for globals, but since handling complex types -- a function in this case
-- isn't trivial, it's not worth it. Just using `pub` is enough:

.`plugin-sample/src/lib.rs`
[source, rust]
----
#[no_mangle]
pub fn with_extern(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a.min(b)
}
----

And the basic runtime can be implemented with
https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer[Wasmer]. I was initially going to use
https://github.com/FreeMasen/wasmer-plugin[`wasmer-plugin`], which includes
procedural macros to help reduce the overall boilerplate (which will be more
important later on), but it seems to be abandoned since 2019. I wanted to try
the lower-level interface of Wasmer myself to learn more about it anyway, so
I'll just use that for now. If we ended up using Wasm for Tremor I'd try
updating and maintaining `wasmer-plugin` to make the code a bit prettier.

.`src/main.rs`
[source, rust]
----
fn run_plugin(_path: &str) -> Result<(), WasmerError> {
    // For reference, Feather also reads the plugins with `fs::read`:
    // https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/blob/07c64678f80ff77be3dbd3d99fbe5558b4e72c97/quill/cargo-quill/src/main.rs#L107
    let module_wat = fs::read(&path)?;
    let store = Store::default();
    let module = Module::new(&store, &module_wat)?;
    // No imports needed; the object will be empty for now
    let import_object = imports! {};
    let instance = Instance::new(&module, &import_object)?;

    println!("Running plugin:");
    let min_extern: NativeFunc<(i32, i32), i32> = instance.exports.get_native_function("with_extern")?;
    println!("  min(1, 2): {}", min_extern.call(1, 2)?);
    println!("  min(-10, 10): {}", min_extern.call(-10, 10)?);
    println!("  min(2000, 2000): {}", min_extern.call(2000, 2000)?);

    Ok(())
}
----

Running it:

[source, text]
----
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
$ cd plugin-simple
$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
$ cd ..
$ cargo run --release -- plugin-sample/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/plugin_sample.wasm
Running plugin:
  min(1, 2): 1
  min(-10, 10): -10
  min(2000, 2000): 2000
----

Some questions:

* What's the difference between the https://docs.rs/wasmer/[`wasmer`] crate and
  https://docs.rs/wasmer-runtime/[`wasmer_runtime`]?
* What about exporting types more complex than an `i32`? Is it possible to
  export a struct that implements a specific trait?

==== `wasmer` vs `wasmer_runtime`

This was confusing for me at first, since both crates seem to have a very
similar interface and almost the same set of authors. Some tutorials used
`wasmer`, but others `wasmer_runtime`.

The difference seems to be that `wasmer_runtime` was updated about a year ago,
while `wasmer` got an upgrade to v2.0.0 just two months back. The last release
of `wasmer_runtime` is v0.17 (v0.18 seems to be yanked), and the first one of
`wasmer` is the same one, so my bet is that `wasmer_runtime` is the name of the
crate their team used previously, and they eventually deprecated it in favor of
`wasmer`.

I've opened an https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/issues/2539[issue] upstream so
that this is hopefully more clear to future users.

==== More complex types

Wasm only allows importing and exporting items of basic types (integers
and floating point <<wasmer-types>>). So in order to interact with custom
``struct``s or ``enum``s the user has to construct them in Wasm's memory (which
can be accessed directly by the runtime, and vice versa), and use pointers to
access them from either side. As to exporting structs that implement a specific
trait, as long as the trait's size is known, it should be possible to do so
via pointers as well.

All of this requires [de]serializing the data into memory with a crate like
https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode[`bincode`], which I'll try to use myself
later on in this post.

== Generics

In conclusion, in Wasm's case there's no point in asking ourselves if there's
support for generics or not, as it's going to have a considerable overhead
anyway.

Generics are almost inevitable in Rust. One might want to use them to:

* Handle lifetimes
* Use async traits. A trait with an `async` method will work thanks to generics
  in the future (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44265[GATs]).

There are ways to work around these, but they of course mean additional
overhead:

* Lifetimes: smart pointers like `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>` (TODO: raw pointers + unsafe?)
* Async (GATs): just like how it works nowadays with `async_trait`, by boxing
  the `Future`. TODO: add reference and example.

It turns out I wasn't the first person to ask that question, and Michael had a
few ideas about it. Since we already know generics in plugins are fundamentally
impossible, we'll just see what alternatives there are. Rust needs to know the
size of the objects it's dealing with at compile-time -- which is when generics
works -- something that's not available when using dynamically loaded libraries.
It's really easy to prove in Rust with the following example:

[source, rust]
----
extern {
    fn foo<T>();
}
----

Which results in the error:

[source, text]
----
error[E0044]: foreign items may not have type parameters
 --> src/lib.rs:2:5
  |
2 |     fn foo<T>();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't have type parameters
  |
  = help: replace the type parameters with concrete types like `u32`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0044`.
----

Interestingly enough, you can export `extern` functions declared _in Rust_. This
will compile:

[source, rust]
----
extern fn foo<T>() {}
----

This confused me in the beginning; it made me think generic functions through
FFI would be possible. But as described in
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15831[the original issue that allowed
them], they're only supported to pass callbacks to C functions.

== Benchmarking

I've always wanted to run some benchmarks in order to find out the actual
difference in performance between dynamic loading (with native code) and Wasm
(with interpreted code). Of course, the former will be faster. But, is it
noticeable?

Now that I have some examples of both dynamic loading and Wasm plugins, I can
make a few benchmarks in order to see the difference by myself. The `wasm-bench`
and `dynamic-bench` directories in
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/pdk-experiments[pdk-experiments] can be
compiled and then ran with
https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.7.0/book/benchmark-tests.html[Rust's integrated
benchmarking system] (which requires nightly for now)
