TODO: use appropiate benchmarks for each case, and indicate where the
improvements may occur in specific. Indicate assumptions and known bias as well.

This final article will focus mostly on getting our plugin system ready for
deployment. This means verifying the behaviour is what we expect, and
benchmarking thoroughly to ensure the performance demands are met.

== Benchmarking process

Before running any benchmarks, we should ensure our process is appropiate so
that we will get precise results.

=== Measuring performance

* Flamegraph
* `perf.data`: `perf report --no-children -i FILE`: reduced `memmove` doesn't
  mean there's more move necessarily, just that something else got slower. Tip:
  take a screenshot and draw lines. TODO: look into what kernel.kallsyms and
  similars are.
* Raw metrics: throughput, maximum and minimum latency, standard deviation, etc.
* https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html[Visual histograms]

=== Hardware availability

My first issue was that the only machine that I currently have available for
free is a laptop. It's not too bad, but it's not the best thing for
benchmarking. I had to close all the programs that were open before running
anything, and it often throttled.

The Tremor team ended up helping me out by adding me to the dedicated
benchmarking server they have. This made the process much easier, and more
accurate.

One great way to ensure the result variance is too high is to run the exact same
benchmark twice after all the initial setup:

=== Running the benchmarks

I started with just a few command line instructions and ended up with a
decently-sized bash script:

* It validated the configuration (the chosen benchmarks and binaries) before
  running anything. This way I avoided waiting for half an hour for the
  benchmarks to finish, only to find an error in one of them and have to start
  from scratch.
* It performed a few warmup rounds before the actual benchmarks. This was
  specially important when I used my laptop at the beginning; the first few runs
  were the fastest, but as the device started to overhead, its performance
  degraded considerably.

== Results

These were performed iteratively. The speed should improve as more and more
experiments are done.

=== Experiments

==== Conversions

.Converting ``Value``s
image::/blog/plugin-end/with_value_conv.png[]

.Not converting ``Value``s
image::/blog/plugin-end/without_value_conv.png[]

.Half the execution time of `on_event` was `Value` conversions

.Percentage of cycles wasted on `Value` conversions

.Percentage of cycles wasted on `ValueAndMeta` conversions
image::/blog/plugin-end/cycles_into_valueandmeta.png[]

According to the flamegraph 7% of the execution time was just conversions
between regular and PDK types (TODO insert screenshot with search)

==== `abi_stable`

.Using `abi_stable`

.Specifically, ``abi_stable``'s complex destructors

==== Change of HashMap

=== Initial PDK impact

* connectors vs pdk vs pdk-singlevalue

// TODO: steps may have to do with allocations: erased types with boxes??

.Ran on the laptop

=== Double box impact

* pdk-box vs pdk-nobox

.Ran on the benchmarking server

=== Hashmap optimization impact

* pdk-hashbrown vs pdk-halfbrown
* knownkey vs noknownkey

// TODO: mention how the passthrough benchmark isn't enough; passthrough:
// optimal case.

== Conclusion

* Throughput degraded by 35% initially
* Latency had also been affected considerably at every percentile (TODO insert
  histogram here)
* After X iterations, throughput was degraded only by Y%.

Lastly, I've found it especially rewarding to do all of this in an open source
environment. Even if you're working for a company with propietary software,
please try to contribute upstream instead of forking or patching. Try to be nice
to those who are saving you so much work, and submit a PR or an issue:

I've been keeping track of the contributions I made as a reference and out of
curiosity. Some of them are more important than others, but it's still a decent
metric for the results of the mentorship, in my opinion. This skips the issues
or pull requests that:

* Contributed nothing (e.g., asking questions or discarded ideas).
* Were repetitive (e.g., I made a few identical PRs in Tremor when I was fixing
  problems with Git).

I also managed to break the compiler while working on this plugin system. It may
not be as rare as one would think, but for some reason I felt oddly proud to
achieve it, so I'll share it here :)

It's seemingly related to incremental compilation and
