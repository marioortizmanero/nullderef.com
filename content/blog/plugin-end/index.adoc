TODO: use appropiate benchmarks for each case, and indicate where the
improvements may occur in specific. Indicate assumptions and known bias as well.

real world: throughput-logging-json
////

Welcome to the final article of this series! I'll focus on getting our plugin
system ready for deployment. This means verifying the behaviour is what we
expect, and benchmarking thoroughly to ensure the performance demands are met.

== Benchmarking

Before running any benchmarks, we should ensure our process is appropiate so
that we will get precise results.

=== Measuring performance

Here are some methods I used for benchmarking:

* Flamegraph
* `perf.data`: `perf report --no-children -i FILE`: reduced `memmove` doesn't
  mean there's more move necessarily, just that something else got slower. Tip:
  take a screenshot and draw lines. TODO: look into what kernel.kallsyms and
  similars are.
* Raw metrics: throughput, maximum and minimum latency, standard deviation, etc.
* https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html[High Dynamic Range
  (HDR) histograms]: Tremor's benchmarks generate a log with latency
  percentiles, which can later be turned into a more visual graph.

=== Hardware availability

My first issue was that the only machine that I currently have available for
free is a laptop. It's not too bad, but it's not the best thing for
benchmarking. I had to close all the programs that were open before running
anything, and it often throttled.

The Tremor team ended up helping me out by adding me to the dedicated
benchmarking server they have. This made the process much easier, and more
accurate.

One great way to ensure the result variance is too high is to run the exact same
benchmark twice after all the initial setup:

// TODO: make names shorter

=== Running the benchmarks

I started with just a few command line instructions and ended up with a
decently-sized bash script:

* It validated the configuration (the chosen benchmarks and binaries) before
  running anything. This way I avoided waiting for half an hour for the
  benchmarks to finish, only to find an error in one of them and have to start
  from scratch.
* It performed a few warmup rounds before the actual benchmarks. This was
  specially important when I used my laptop at the beginning; the first few runs
  were the fastest, but as the device started to overhead, its performance
  degraded considerably.

== Results

These were performed iteratively. The speed should improve as more and more
experiments are done.

=== Experiments

==== Conversions

.Converting ``Value``s
image::/blog/plugin-end/with_value_conv.png[]

.Not converting ``Value``s
image::/blog/plugin-end/without_value_conv.png[]

.Half the execution time of `on_event` was `Value` conversions

.Percentage of cycles wasted on `Value` conversions
image::/blog/plugin-end/cycles_into_value.png[]

.Percentage of cycles wasted on `ValueAndMeta` conversions
image::/blog/plugin-end/cycles_into_valueandmeta.png[]

According to the flamegraph 7% of the execution time was just conversions
between regular and PDK types (TODO insert screenshot with search)

==== `abi_stable`

.Using `abi_stable`

.Specifically, ``abi_stable``'s complex destructors

.Ran on the benchmarking server

=== Hashmap optimization impact

* pdk-hashbrown vs pdk-halfbrown
* knownkey vs noknownkey

== Conclusion

* Throughput degraded by 35% initially
* Latency had also been affected considerably at every percentile (TODO insert
  histogram here)
* After X iterations, throughput was degraded only by Y%.

Lastly, I've found it especially rewarding to do all of this in an open source
environment. Even if you're working for a company with propietary software,
please try to contribute upstream instead of forking or patching. Try to be nice
to those who are saving you so much work, and submit a PR or an issue:

== Open Source Contributions

One of my favorite parts of the project has been contributing so much to all
kinds of open source dependencies, so I've maintained a list of its occurrences.
Some are more important than others, but it's still a decent metric for my
results. This skips the issues or pull requests that:

* Contributed nothing (e.g., asking questions or discarded ideas).
* Were repetitive (e.g., I made a few identical PRs in Tremor when I was fixing
  problems with Git).

== Other Achievements

=== Breaking the Compiler

I also managed to break the Rust compiler while working on this plugin system.
It may not be as rare as one would think, but for some reason I felt oddly proud
to achieve it, so I'll share it here :)

image::/blog/plugin-end/rustc_crash.png[width=100%, align=center]

It's seemingly related to incremental compilation, and
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90608[someone had already reported it
before]. It should be fixed in a future version, and I haven't come across it
again.

=== LFX Mentorship Showcase

I already shared this in a previous article, but for completeness I'll repeat it
here. This online event made it possible to showcase my work back in January
with a https://youtu.be/htLCyqY0kt0?t=3166[quick 15-minute presentation]. I
couldn't get into many technical details, but I'm sure it will be useful to
someone else considering a https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/[LFX
Mentorship] or https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code].

=== My Final Year Project

Finally, I have recently submitted this as
https://github.com/marioortizmanero/final-year-project[my bachelor's Final Year
Project]. It takes a more academic approach, and I rigorously reorganized
everything so that even developers unfamiliar with Rust can understand it. The
abstract is in English, but unfortunately, the rest is in Spanish due to absurd
university rules.

=== KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2022

Thanks to the Tremor team, I was also able to presentially attend
https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/[KubeCon +
CloudNativeCon] 2022 in Valencia, Spain! It was my first conference and I was
very pleasantly surprised by how nice everyone was. I had tons of fun and met
smart folk with all kinds of backgrounds. If you're on the fence about attending
something similar, I strongly recommend you to go for it!
