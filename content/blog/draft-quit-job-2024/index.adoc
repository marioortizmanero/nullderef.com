// FEEDBACK:
// Maybe too much 'I', 'me', and 'my'?
// Lower down on 'really', 'very', 'super', 'some', 'kind of', 'a lot', 'make
// sure'
// Upgrade vocabulary?
// Long sentences?
// Less technical?

I never expected quitting a job to be so hard! My time at Lyft has been an
enriching journey. Tons of smart people at three very different teams, where
I've learned how the industry works. The technical challenges were endless: from
user-facing features in the app to improving the safety of

routing].

But after two years, I've realized that it just wasn't making me happy. My
disconnect with the product was too big, and so much remote work didn't help,
either. The desire to explore grew, with the hope that something else could
bring more fulfillment.

I've always aspired to build a company, and this was a good moment in life to
try. Now or never. So here I am, soon to be jobless, contemplating life, yet
excited about what's next.

My company might fail (in fact, the odds are against me). But I'll have tried
and learned! This decision reassures me I'm making the best out of life, and it
frees me of regrets. Mostly. It's still pretty insane that I quit.

It's early in my journey, but I can't stop exploring my area of interest:
phones. Or rather, phonesn't. Not having had the best year of my life, I found
myself on the phone too much. The negative effects became obvious, and I want to
do something about it.

This space is quite a challenge. Everyone overuses their phone in their own way.
You have big companies _optimizing_ their app to get you stuck on it. And often,
overuse is a symptom of a deeper problem, where you'd be better off directly
fixing that.

Yet, it's such a huge issue that I'm confident I can build something valuable.
You don't need to be completely addicted to your phone to want to use it less.
Among the thousand possible ideas -- even

might get started with an innovative app to control screentime. It's frustrating
that no existing apps have gone mainstream. Let's make it fun to reduce your
usage.
