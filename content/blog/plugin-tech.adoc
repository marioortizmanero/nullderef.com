== Introduction

In this article I will further analyze how a Plugin Development Kit (PDK) could
be implemented in Rust. Note that I'm no expert in the topic; my objective is to
merely collect all the information I've found so far and present it as a
summary, with enough resources for the reader to learn more on their own and
make their own decisions.

[[requirements]]
== The Problem

This is actually part of my Google Summer of Code project for
https://www.tremor.rs/[Tremor]. My first article about a Plugin System in Rust
was in the https://nullderef.com/blog/gsoc-proposal/[proposal], which serves as
a full introduction and may be interesting as well. While this will specifically
cover Tremor's use case, I'm sure many other applications in the future will
have similar requirements for their own program. And considering the few
articles I found about plugins in Rust, this may be helpful to the community.

NOTE: It seems Google hasn't allocated any slots for Tremor in the end. That
saddens me a lot as I was very excited to work with them. I wanted to thank the
devs for being welcoming and having such a nice community. And I still wanted to
release this post in case it's useful to them or anyone else.

After showing the proposal to the Tremor team, I was given an important
suggestion: in this case there isn't really a need to be able to write plugins
from multiple programming languages; it's not worth the additional complexity.
It would definitely be interesting but with this I can focus on the main
problems I discovered in my proposal: the ABI instability, and safety.

Besides that, the rest of the main points to consider remain the same:

. *Mandatory:* Being able to load/unload the plugins both at start-time and at
  run-time.
. *Mandatory:* Cross-platform support
. *Mandatory:* Low overhead
. *Mandatory:* Available at least from Rust
. *Extra:* <<safety,Safety>>
. *Extra:* <<back-comp,Backwards compatibility>>
. *Extra*: Not much work to port from the existing implementations

[[safety]]
== Safety Concerns

I've been wanting to take a look at the possible safety concerns a PDK could
bring to Tremor since the initial proposal.

NOTE: Depending on the approach that is taken for the Plugin System,
implementing solutions to some of the points I make below can be really complex,
so I wouldn't work on them for the initial deadline. For now, it's something we
have to be aware of.

=== Unsafe Code

Many of the technologies that can be used to implement a Plugin System work with
unsafe code, like <<ffi,FFIs>> or <<memory-sharing,IPC Memory Sharing>>. This
isn't necessarily a problem if it's self-contained and thoroughly reviewed, but
we lose some of the safety guarantees Rust provides us, increasing the
maintenance cost of the library.

It takes considerably more work to make sure the implementation is sound, even
with tools like https://github.com/rust-lang/miri[MIRI], which I plan on
integrating into Tremor if I do end up having to use `unsafe`.

=== Error Resilience

Rust doesn't protect its users from leaking memory. In fact, it's as easy as
calling `mem::forget`. The thing is that if a plugin leaks memory, the entire
process also does, meaning that Tremor's performance could be affected by
incorrectly developed plugins.

This doesn't happen just with memory leaks; a plugin could abort or panic and
crash the entire thing very easily.

Ideally, Tremor could detect plugins that aren't performing well and stop them
before it's too late. The core of the program could continue running even when a
plugin fails, and perhaps warn the user about its malfunctioning, for optimal
error resilience.

=== Remote Code Execution via Plugins

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model#Security[This was a problem
with Internet Explorer], for example. It used COM and ActiveX, which implement
no sandboxing at all and were ran directly on the user's machine, allowing
malware to be included in plugins with the ability to execute arbitrary code on
the host machine. This can be less of a problem when installing only trusted
plugins via digital signatures, but it's still a huge risk.

In the case of Tremor plugins this is a similar problem. The end user -- those
who will add plugins to their configuration -- is a developer, who should be
more wary of what they're including in their own projects. But the truth is that
it isn't any better.

I would compare the situation more specifically to how package managers like
https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] work (or anything that deals with dependencies,
really). The entire infrastructure is usually based on trust; noone's really
stopping you from uploading a malicious package/crate for remote code execution
or to steal data <<npm-trust-1>> <<npm-trust-2>>. Plugins are like dependencies in
this case; they have full access to the host's computer, and thus shouldn't be
trusted by default.

An improved approach to Node + npm would be something like
https://github.com/denoland/deno[Deno], which is a secure by default
JavaScript/TypeScript runtime. This is enabled thanks to sandboxing, and
requires the developer to manually toggle e.g. access to the filesystem or to
the network. This is no panacea because people might end up enabling whatever
permission is required by the dependency they want to install without thinking
about it, but it's similar to `unsafe`: at least it makes you aware that you
might mess up.

One could argue that their program is realistically going to be ran in a Virtual
Machine or a container most of the times, where this may not matter so much. But
should you really assume that? Should user safety rely on the fact that the
machine is ran on an isolated kernel? Containers, by the way, introduce a much
bigger overhead in comparison to some sandboxing methods. And even if the system
as a whole is isolated, there is still a possibility for internal leaks: the
Postgres plugin has access to whatever is being used by the Apache Kafka plugin,
which may have sensitive logs you don't want anyone to see.

[[back-comp]]
== Backward Compatibility

As I discovered in the last post, backward compatibility is complicated for
plugin systems in Rust with the typical approach, a FFI. Since it doesn't
currently offer a stable ABI -- and probably never will -- the slightest
difference between the version used to compile a plugin and the core of the
program will break it.

Apart from the instability issues incoming from the Rust compiler, the core
itself may change with frequency as well. And this isn't limited to dynamic
libraries. If the plugin receives a struct from the core, but the struct had one
of its members removed in a new version, it's all broken again.

=== Possible Solutions

The easiest fix for backward compatibility issues I can come up with is to
serialize and deserialize the data with a flexible protocol rather than using
its binary representation directly. If something like JSON is used to
communicate between the core and its plugins, adding a field to a message won't
break anything, and removing one can be done via a deprecation process.
Unfortunately, this introduces some overhead the application may not be
interested in.

Other more involved methods for binary representations include <<swift-abi>>:

* Reserving space in the struct for future use.
* Making the struct an opaque type, requiring function calls to get the fields.
* Giving the struct a pointer to its "`version 2`" data (opaque in "`version
  1`").

As to breakage due to compiler version mismatches, there are a couple ways this
can be fixed that I'll investigate in later sections. Some technologies other
than <<ffi,FFI>> don't have this problem by nature, like <<ipc,IPC>> or
<<scripting-langs,scripting languages>>, and we have some unofficial fixes from
the community available, like `abi_stable`.

=== Avoiding Breakage

There are times when breakage is inevitable. Tremor may want to rewrite part of
its core or finally remove a deprecated feature without being afraid of breaking
all the plugins previously developed.

For that, the plugins must embed a bit of metadata about the different versions
of rustc/core/etc it was developed for, so that when it's loaded by Tremor, it
may check if they're compatible, rather than breaking in mysterious ways.
https://nullderef.com/blog/gsoc-proposal/#_defining_an_interface[I already
talked about this in the past], so I won't get into the details.

== Possible Approaches

The following are the most viable technologies that could be used as the base of
a PDK. Some of the won't match the requirements I mentioned earlier at first
glance, but it's a good idea to at least _consider_ all of them. I haven't
written a line of code yet, so if an approach were to catch someone's eye we
could investigate more about it. I will rate each of the alternatives in a scale
from 1 to 5 (approximately) in order to easen the decision-taking.

[[scripting-langs]]
=== Scripting Languages

Plenty of projects use scripting languages to extend their functionality at
runtime, like Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash or JavaScript. Most notably, Vim created
its own scripting language, Vimscript, in order to be fully customizable, and
NeoVim is now pushing http://www.lua.org/[Lua] as a first-class language for
configuration. Even Tremor itself has the interpreted query language
https://docs.tremor.rs/tremor-query/[`tremor-query`] for configuration.

Lua is seen in game development; it's a quite simple language with a very
performant JIT implementation, which in any case I think would be the best
option here. It could be embedded into the main program's core (it's only 247 kB
compiled! <<lua-wiki>>) and used to load plugins at either start-time or
run-time. And knowing it's used in games, which are _obsessed_ with performance,
it might not be that much of a big deal in that regard.

NOTE: There are https://arewegameyet.rs/ecosystem/scripting/[languages
specifically designed to extend Rust's capabilities], which you might be
interested in, but I'll just simplify this part by going for Lua.

Rust has libraries like https://github.com/amethyst/rlua[`rlua`] which provide
bindings for interoperability with Lua. `rlua` in particular seems to focus on
having an idiomatic and safe interface, which is rare for a bindings library and
good news, though it seems to be currently semi-abandoned, and forked by
https://github.com/khvzak/mlua[`mlua`]. Unfortunately, after digging a bit the
Rust ecosystem for Lua bindings doesn't seem to be as mature as I'd like for a
project this big; there's still some work to do to reach more stability.

Lua gets extra points in safety. It's possible to sandbox it by blocking
whichever functions you don't want users to access <<lua-sandbox>> (though it's
"`tricky and generally speaking difficult to get right`"). Similarly, one can
also handle resource exhaustion issues within Lua programs. Not to mention that
this wouldn't require `unsafe` at all with an optimal set of bindings.

Anyhow, the main deal breaker with scripting languages in this case is that it
would be extremely complicated to port everything in Tremor so that it can be
used from Lua. For new projects this could perhaps be something interesting, but
not if the entirety of the already existing plugins have to be rewritten.

Still, it's a pretty interesting option for new projects, as you have ABI
stability guarantees, solid safety overall, and it's very straightforward to
use.

[[ipc]]
=== Inter-Process Communication

Another possibility for plugins is to define a protocol for Inter-Process
Communication, turning your program into a server that extends its capabilities
by connecting to external plugins. For instance, most text editors use this
method to support the
https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol],
which uses JSON-RPC.

There are of course multiple ways to do IPC, which I'll briefly list below.
Performance-wise, this graph shows a comparison of the overhead of each of them
<<ipc-wisc>>:

image::/blog/plugin-tech/ipc-comparison.png[IPC comparison, width=60%, align=center]

[[sockets]]
==== Based on Sockets

Sockets are the "`worst`"-performing alternative in the previous chart, but they're
so common and easy to use in most languages that it's worth taking a look at.
Using relatively lightweight protocols like
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protocol Buffers], the
performance would be close to passing raw structs, but with improved
backwards/forwards compatibility <<protobuf-perf>>. JSON would probably not make
that big of a difference in terms of performance either. This would make it
possible to write a plugin in any language as well -- including Rust -- as long
as there's an implementation of the protocol available. But there's still
noticeable overhead when communicating via sockets; sending and receiving the
messages can be much costlier than just calling a function, even if this happens
on localhost.

This alternative is much more interesting than <<scripting-langs>> for Tremor's
specific case: we don't have to completely rewrite everything, since Rust can
still be used, and implementing the protocol to communicate between the Tremor
core and its plugins should be as easy as `\#[derive(Serialize)]` for sending
and `#[derive(Deserialize)]` for receiving.

As to safety, separate processes imply that malfunctioning plugins don't affect
Tremor directly, and the PDK basically consists on implementing servers, which
require no `unsafe` at all and has much more popularity and support in Rust.
It's still hard to properly sandbox the plugins, though.

Overall, I consider this a very solid solution, with its main drawback being
performance. I can't really guess the effect this would have in Tremor's speed,
so I would love to create a quick benchmark when I get to implement the first
prototypes to see if it's actually the best choice, if Tremor devs think it's
worth my time.

[[pipes]]
==== Based on Pipes

Pipes have always been fairly popular specifically on Unix systems, and enable
Inter-Process Communication with less overhead than sockets. They are made to be
ran on the same machine, which is exactly what we need. The terminal file
manager https://github.com/jarun/nnn[nnn] uses this approach: plugins can read
from a FIFO (Named Pipe) to receive selections from nnn (lists of files or
directories) and act accordingly.

The rest is basically the same as with <<sockets, Sockets>>, maybe with extra
points for performance, and less for Rust availability, since there don't seem
to be any reliable libraries for pipes (maybe
https://docs.rs/interprocess/1.1.1/interprocess/[`interprocess`] or
https://crates.io/crates/ipipe[`ipipe`]). But really, are libraries necessary at
all? The `std` library
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/process/pipe.html[has support
for cross-platform pipes when executing external commands] for stdin, stdout,
and stderr, which most times is enough. The plugin can just use stdin to receive
messages and stdout to send them. If that's enough for your case then it's
vastly simplified.

[[memory-sharing]]
==== Based on Memory Sharing

Knowing that the plugins are intended to be on the same machine as the core of
Tremor, there's no need to actually send and receive messages. One can share
memory between multiple processes and send notifications to receive updates. The
performance is comparable to using a FFI, since the only overhead is the initial
cost from setting up the shared pages, having regular memory access afterwards
<<memory-share-so>>.

This feature heavily depends on the system's kernel, so it may hurt the
"`Cross-Compatibility`" requirement. We have libraries like
https://docs.rs/shared_memory[`shared_memory`] pass:[+]
https://docs.rs/raw_sync[`raw_sync`] in Rust that wrap all the OS
implementations under the same interface, but admittedly, they don't seem
anywhere near as popular as most of the other alternatives. Not to mention that
the examples for `shared_memory` _do_ use `unsafe`, and a lot of it.

Maybe if it was easier to use this would be a good idea, but IPC shared memory
doesn't seem to be any better than FFIs overall.

. [{rank-meh}]*3/5* *Backwards compatibility*
. [{rank-good}]*5/5* *Ease of porting existing implementations*

[[ffi]]
=== FFI

This is possibly the _least weird_ way to implement a Plugin Development Kit,
i.e. it's the most popular method I've seen outside of Rust. A _Foreign Function
Interface_ can allow us to directly access resources in separately compiled
objects, even after the linking phase with dynamic loading. It's one of the
fastest options available because there's no overhead at all after dynamically
loading the library.

The main library for this is
https://github.com/nagisa/rust_libloading[`libloading`]. There's also the less
popular https://docs.rs/dlopen/0.1.8/dlopen/[`dlopen`] and
https://github.com/Tyleo/sharedlib[`sharedlib`], with some small differences
<<ffi-comparison>>. It seems to be a lower-level implementation for any kind of
FFI that requires `unsafe` for almost everything -- what I was expecting. Based
on it there's https://github.com/emoon/dynamic_reload[`dynamic_reload`], which
is very interesting in order to "`live reload`" the plugins when they are
recompiled. This would be useful for the development process of the plugins,
since it also handles unloading the _same plugin_ seamlessly, but that's not a
goal for this project so I don't plan on using it. There's also
https://github.com/vberger/dlib[`dlib`], which provides macros to make the
library loading simpler, based on `libloading`.

I already discussed about Rust-to-C FFIs in detail in the
https://nullderef.com/blog/gsoc-proposal/[proposal] and came to the conclusion
that, the same way as with <<scripting-langs>>, it's too much work to create an
internal interface for Tremor through C (with enough time and resources this
would possibly be the best option, though). This leaves us with Rust-to-Rust as
the only option, which is the easiest, but still has important inconvenients:

. Awful safety: lots of `unsafe` usage is required with plenty of caveats
  <<ffi-caveat-1>> <<ffi-caveat-2>>, including subtle differences
  in the interface between Operating Systems <<ffi-cross-platform>>,
  although `dlopen` seems to be better in that regard <<ffi-dlopen-safety>>. No
  sandboxing either. And plugins can abort Tremor's core execution when
  panicking/leaking memory/similars (I haven't been able to find information
  about using `catch_unwind` with Rust-to-Rust FFIs).
. Binary compatibility is not good. Any minor change to either Tremor's
  interface or the version it was compiled with will break the plugin.

I recently discovered the
https://github.com/rodrimati1992/abi_stable_crates[`abi_stable`] crate, which
guarantees Rust ABI's stability unofficially and helps a lot with the binary
compatibility aspect.

It includes FFI-safe alternatives to many of the types in `std`, and even
external ones (namely `crossbeam`, `parking_lot` and `serde_json`). This works
by implementing a
https://docs.rs/abi_stable/*/abi_stable/abi_stability/stable_abi_trait/trait.StableAbi.html[`StableAbi`]
trait that guarantees its FFI-safety, which may be done automatically with one
of its procedural macros. Internal ABI stability is also guaranteed with macros
like `#[sabi(last_prefix_field)]`, which would allow Tremor to add fields to
existing structs
https://github.com/rodrimati1992/abi_stable_crates/blob/19d71ec9175f870c1c784c37dae730b99948cacf/examples/0_modules_and_interface_types/interface/src/lib.rs#L45[without
breaking backwards compatibility].

Fortunately, this crate has a
https://github.com/rodrimati1992/abi_stable_crates/tree/master/examples[few very
detailed examples] one can look at to better understand how it works, and it's
exceptionally well documented. If I've understood it correctly, some of its
inconvenients are the following:

* You have to use the types from `abi_stable` instead of `std` for the values
  passed through FFI.
* The whole crate seems huge and would probably add considerable complexity to
  this FFI method.
* It's worth mentioning that library unloading is a non-feature; although it's
  not going to be implemented for this project, it might in the future.

While it's a really interesting concept and look forward to seeing how it
evolves, I'm not a big fan of having to resort to it. And the fact that it's
unofficial and not that popular doesn't give me full confidence that this will
still work in 5 years, or that it won't be outdated/abandoned. If the FFI method
were to be chosen in the end, perhaps the first version could try without
`abi_stable`, and if ABI breakage ends up being a big problem, the plugin system
could be updated to include it.

More people have tried writing Rust FFIs in the past, thankfully, so we can take
a look at existing tutorials in order to see their experience:

* The one and only Amos wrote an extremely detailed blog post on fasterthanlime
  https://fasterthanli.me/articles/so-you-want-to-live-reload-rust[here],
  specifically about live reloading Rust -- a closely related topic.
* Michael Bryan made a guided introduction to Plugins in Rust
  https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/plugins-in-rust/[here], and also
  wrote a tutorial for his unofficial Rust FFI book
  https://michael-f-bryan.github.io/rust-ffi-guide/dynamic_loading.html[here].
* https://github.com/zicklag[@zicklag], who had read Michael's article, tried it
  by himself in order to add a plugin system to
  https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst[Amethyst], and posted
  https://zicklag.github.io/rust-tutorials/rust-plugins.html[this tutorial].
  When he shared the post on the official Rust forum, it was accompanied by this
  demotivating comment, after failing to implement it for Amethyst:
+
[quote, https://users.rust-lang.org/t/creating-rust-apps-with-dynamically-loaded-rust-plugins/28814/111092]
____
Unfortunately I found that dynamic linking doesn't actually work in Rust across
different versions of Rust, and the technique for plugins also failed, even
inside the same version of Rust, when I tried to compile an app with other
dependencies like Amethyst. That leaves the technique outlined in the tutorial
not very practical for real applications.

The closest thing I’ve found to accomplish something similar is [`abi_stable`].

He also added later on:

It could very well be possible [to use WebAssembly here].
It wouldn't be exactly the same workflow, but I've considered using Wasmtime
or CraneLift, which Wasmtime is built on, to Run Wasm modules as plugins.

He didn't have time to end up doing so, so we'll have to investigate ourselves.

[[wasm]]
=== WebAssembly Interface

Now, this is what I wanted to emphasize in this article! Turns out WebAssembly
isn't limited to web development anymore; it's slowly evolving into a portable
binary-code format. As far as I know, this should be like a mix between <<ffi>>
and <<scripting-langs>>, with a stronger focus in stability and portability.
Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:

[quote, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly]
____
WebAssembly (sometimes abbreviated Wasm) is an open standard that defines a
portable binary-code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual
assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between
such programs and their host environment. The main goal of WebAssembly is to
enable high-performance applications on web pages, #but the format is designed to
be executed and integrated in other environments as well, including standalone
ones.#
____

So to clear it up, *Wasm* is an _assembly language_, and
https://wasi.dev/[*WASI*] is a _system interface_ to run it outside the web. The
latter is extremely well explained
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/[in
this article by Mozilla], I suggest giving it a read for more details.
https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance[This one]
is also very nice to read and explains the isolation system it provides,
specifically.

The two main points WebAssembly offers are, in a nutshell:

* When compiled, it doesn't need to know what Operating System is being
  targeted. This is handled by the runtime, and the binary itself is fully
  portable.
* In order to handle untrustworthy programs, it implements a sandbox. With that,
  the host can limit exactly what a program has access to.

WASI is just a standard, so there's multiple runtimes available. The most
popular ones are coincidentally implemented in Rust as well:
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime[*wasmtime*] and
https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer[*wasmer*]. Both use the
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/README.md[Cranelift]
backend to generate the WebAssembly machine code (although wasmer seems to
support more backends, like LLVM). Then, the runtime can be used to run the
generated `.wasm` binary in different ways (say, as a CLI or a library). This
also means that plugins could be written in any language that compiles to
WebAssembly.

The differences between the two runtimes aren't that big. You can read
https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingWasm[this wiki article for more details,
including examples], but I particularly liked this quote:

[quote]
____
Just based on what they demonstrate, wasmer is more focused on embedding wasm in
your native program, while wasmtime is more focused on executing standalone wasm
programs using WASI. Both are capable of both, it just seems a matter of
emphasis.
____

The article also includes a [.line-through]#not reliable at all# benchmark,
which can serve us as a way to compare its performance with the native code
you'd get with e.g. <<ffi>>. It estimates that Wasm is a bit less than an order
of magnitude slower than native code, and the same applies to memory usage.
https://github.com/jedisct1/webassembly-benchmarks/tree/master/2021-Q1[A more
thorough benchmark] was done in libsodium that shows better results: Wasm can be
just about 3 times slower than native code. Do note that this depends on the
runtime that's being used, and it may improve in the future, as WebAssembly is
just 4 years old.

There's a whole series on how to make a Plugins System with Wasmer
https://freemasen.com/blog/wasmer-plugin-pt-1/[here], which will come in handy
to know what to expect. The usability doesn't actually seem to be that good,
since by default you can only use integers, floating-point or vectors
<<wasmer-types>> as parameters when calling Wasm plugins. For more complex
types, you have to resort to encoding and decoding via a crate like
https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode[`bincode`], although most of the
boilerplate can be reduced with procedural macros, and this opens up the
possibility of using serialization with support for backwards compatibility
within Tremor. The
https://freemasen.com//blog/wasmer-plugin-pt-4/index.html[last part] of the
series is the most interesting one, as it includes a real-world example, with a
version of the final code in https://github.com/FreeMasen/wasmer-plugin[this
repository].

All in all, WebAssembly seems to win against <<ffi>> in terms of security by not
needing `unsafe` at all and including sandboxing by default, at the cost of
efficiency. This is up to the managers of the project and what they consider
more important.

== Prior Art

It's very important to take a look at projects that have already done this in
the past in order to learn from their mistakes and not start from scratch.

Here's a list of some of the libraries I found with Plugin Systems, specifically
written in Rust:

* https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo[`cargo`],
  https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook[`mdbook`]: both have an extension system
  via CLI commands. Adding a subcommand to either of these utilities is as easy
  as creating a binary with a fixed prefix (e.g. `cargo-expand`), and if it's
  available in the `$PATH` when running `cargo`, it will be possible to invoke
  the plugin with `cargo expand` as well.

This is a very interesting approach, specially because of how simple it
is to use. Cargo doesn't seem to need to communicate with the extension at all,
but `mdbook` does use stdin to receive messages and stdout to send them, via
serialization. So it's basically the IPC <<pipes>> approach.

  plugin system allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to
  WebAssembly`".

This is an extremely valuable resource in case the <<wasm>> option is chosen, as
it's very similar to what Tremor needs. One can even subscribe to events in
order to simulate the traits in Tremor that currently use `async`.
+
After trying it out and seeing its source code, it seems to work with a `wasm`
binary that acts as a standalone program, where the communication takes place
via stdin and stdout, serializing and deserializing with
https://serde.rs/[serde]. `zellij` includes a few plugins by default, like the
status bar, or a file manager. Very neat architecture!
* https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor[`xi`]: a now abandoned modern text
  editor. Its plugins, described
  https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html#json[here in
  detail], are based on https://docs.rs/xi-rpc/0.3.0/xi_rpc/[JSON RPC].
+
Text editors overall are very interesting, because they must be built with
extensibility in mind and thus have to implement some kind of plugin system.

** Visual Studio is based on Electron, so it has a renderer process for the
   frontend, and a main process with Node. Its extensions share the same event
   loop,
   https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75627#issuecomment-519125065[which
   has been an issue for a long time in case an extension blocks temporarily],
   causing lag.
** Eclipse's plugin architecture is based on Java classes <<eclipse>> loaded at
   runtime and configured with XML manifests.
* https://bevyengine.org/[`bevy`]: a very promising game engine whose features
  are implemented as plugins. Most times they are loaded at compile-time, but
  the
  https://docs.rs/bevy/0.5.0/bevy/dynamic_plugin/index.html[`bevy::dynamic_plugin`]
  allows this to happen at runtime. It uses `libloading` internally, with
  actually

  little code].

== Conclusion

This article has covered quite a few ways to approach a Plugin System. The final
choice depends on what trade-offs the project wants to make. Most of them
require sacrificing some level of performance for safety or usability. Here's a
drawing that *_very roughly_* compares the main methods:

There's never a single answer in programming: how much performance are you
willing to lose in exchange for safety and usability? Is that performance
actually measurable, or is it just hypothetical? Don't forget that this depends
on the use case, so make sure you run a couple benchmarks if the resulting
overhead may be important for your program.
