As I left university and joined the industry, I realized it didn't look like anything I'd ever done before in my classes. It probably depends on the university, but in my case they didn't teach many practical things you'd hope. This includes observability, politics, or dealing with huge codebases. I didn't even know what being oncall was. And we also had to learn `git` by ourselves.

I owe most of my programming knowledge to open source, and its communities. Contributing to a project I like, working with others, chatting on the Discord servers, etc.

So why don't most universities just make it mandatory to contribute to OSS? It's still not the same as industry, but the only way to learn that is through an internship. And even then, you're most likely in a bubble, doing a self-contained project.

Contributing to OSS would help students see what it's like to contribute to a huge existing codebase. It'd also be very exciting to be able to choose what project you want to contribute to. As a Firefox user, it'd have been amazing to have time to contribute there, for example.

Not to mention it'd be such a good initiative for OSS in general. Hopefully, it'd teach students to be more mindful of OSS maintainers when they eventually use libraries in whatever company they join.
