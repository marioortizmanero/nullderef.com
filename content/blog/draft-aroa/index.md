{{< viz3d-setup >}}

Today, I want to convince you of how admirable my sister, Aroa, was. We lost her in November 2023, so I wanted to condense her essence into a single post and talk about mental health.

My sister taught me a lot because of how different we were. For one, she seemingly gave no fucks. You could see her with the weirdest clothing combinations that somehow made her look fabulous. TODO with TODO? Slashing. TODO with TODO? Cool as hell. Her expressions and personality accompanied her resourceful style. She was like a pink dense cloud that absorbed and impressed everyone.

I'm not sure she was aware of her coolness. Her artistic skills were amazing, particularly as she got started with 3D paintings. For example, here she cut off pictures from a magazine and glued more things on top:

She always had a hard time finding a career that would fit her. It was astronomy for a bit, and she even tried a semester of geology. She signed up for an automotive workshop and later gave a try to content creation for CBD companies. We built her CV together, but we never managed to convince her to pursue arts! Just look:

TODO: a few art pieces in here

Aroa showed me that people are more than their career; you also need to find fulfillment outside of it. Explore, learn, create. When I moved to Munich because of work, I stopped writing on my blog. Learning German was important to me, but I thought it'd be too much. I was having fun in life and learning on my job, but I wasn't learning about me. Make sure you have unproductiveness in every day of your life and to embrace boredom when possible.

My therapists always asked me for rituals to remember her. Going to a techno club in her memory is probably my favorite, and luckily, I live in Germany. Here are three playlists that define her best:

She also skated and did boxing

And was passionate about cinema. Both in fan-favorite TODO and stupid ones like TODO or TODO. She literally knew Ali-G by heart. Every single line.

She even participated in First Dates.

## How was it?

My mother called me to tell me the news. The timing was extraordinary, as I was a few minutes away from a flight taking off. My world fell apart: I couldn't stop crying. The attentive flight attendants took me to their reserved row at the front to calm my nerves. After crying for so long, they became worried I'd dehydrate or that it'd turn into a panic attack. So they asked me to take a tranquilizer... as a rectal suppository. For flight reasons, I suppose. I'm sure Aroa would have gotten a huuuuuge kick out of that. Man, I know she's still laughing somewhere.

Being stuck for 4 hours in a flight, I thought of all the things that can be thought, and I felt all the feelings that can be felt. Not necessarily all of them being negative.

When I reunited with my family, I couldn't comprehend what had happened. What I could definitely see, is how completely broken my loved ones were. Instinctively, I worried more for others than for myself at the beginning. This took time, but I've gotten better at it.

One particularly shocking part was the physical reaction --- I didn't know the concept of "[somatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization)". Mental health _is_ physical health. After the airplane call, my arms literally went numb for several minutes. It was completely disconcerting and alarming. My physical strength later took a nosedive: I got ill and the worst back cramps of my life left me in bed for two days straight. The exhaustion lasted for weeks. My brain was ready to swim for kilometers, but frustratingly, my body refused.

I'm not sure how much influence this had on me [quitting my job](/blog/quit-job-2024). The first thing therapists tell you is to not make life decisions based on events like this. So I waited and kept thinking. Building a company wasn't a new idea. If anything, losing Aroa was a reminder to make the best out of life. And it's a good thing I'm still young to do stupid things.

#### Therapy

My idea of therapy was sitting in a white neat room with someone asking you questions. While the questions part remains true, the environment in which they are asked is essential. Some can find more comfort in sharing a beer with a laid-back therapist, while others can open up easily in nature or among horses. If that's the only way the therapist has to have the patent stick to it, then it's better than nothing.

At the beginning, therapy may make things worse. It's like getting all the shit outside and mixing it together. It stinks and makes you cry. But in the long term, you need it to heal.

BP is a very tough mental disease that is definitely solvable. It needs specialists/experts and work for prevention.

<!-- Importantly, this lack of care wasn't only towards the patient, but also for the -->

<!-- Even if the patient goes to therapy, most of their time is spent at home. -->
