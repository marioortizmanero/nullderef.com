Hello! I've recently had the pleasure of giving a talk at this year's [TremorCon](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-tremor-community-presents-tremor-con-2022/). I really enjoy public speaking, so this has been an excellent opportunity to get better at it (let me know your thoughts!). In case you missed it, you can check out the recording here:
