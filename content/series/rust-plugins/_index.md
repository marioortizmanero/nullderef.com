title: "A Plugin System in Rust"
description: "My [LFX
mentorship](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/b90f7174-fc53-40bc-b9e2-9905f88c38ff)
with [Tremor](https://www.tremor.rs/), in which I implement a Plugin System to
maximize modularity and reduce Rust's wild compilation times. This is done with
[dynamic loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading), but its
alternatives are also covered in detail in the first articles."
