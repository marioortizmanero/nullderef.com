title: "RSpotify"
description: "I was a contributor to [the RSpotify
library](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify) to sharpen my Rust skills.
This crate provides easy-to-use and complete bindings for [the Spotify web
API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). I tried to improve it
in all sorts of ways, such as reducing bloat, adding features, or improving its
performance. You can read more about them in this series."
