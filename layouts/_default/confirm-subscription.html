      <blockquote>
        Snails can sleep for up to three years. This prolonged hibernation period
        usually occurs in response to unfavorable weather conditions, such as
        extreme dryness. During this time, snails seal themselves inside their
        shells with a layer of mucus to prevent desiccation, allowing them to
        survive without water.
