    I'm Mario. I love building new things, especially if they're open source!
    Currently, I work for Lyft as a backend engineer within the routing infra
    team. If you're ever taken through a crappy dirt road, that was partly my
    fault, sorry.

    My favorite topics are distributed systems and overall systems
    programming, for which I mostly use Rust, C++, and Python. Some noteworthy
    projects in my portfolio include:
